And as the story of Narnia begins to unfold, so to does a classic tale that has enchanted readers of all ages for over half a century.<p>This stunning version of the classic <em>The Lion, The Witch and the Wardrobe</em>, illustrated by Christian Burningham, comes with a special recording of the story which features a full production and specially composed music which transports the listener straight to the heart of Narnia. An absolute must for Narnia fans, and an excellent way of introducing the magical story to a new generation of readers. -<br><br>-<em>Susan Harrison</em></br></br></p></span>

S. Lewis was in the process of organising the stories into chronological sequence but died before he could make his intended changes to cause the series to read more smoothly. As they stand now, if read in order of Narnian chronology one notices some difficulties in tone. Jadis, a heroic Amazonian figure in "The Magician's Nephew" shrinks into a mean-spirited witch in "The Lion, The Witch, and The Wardrobe". The tone of the various volumes varies considerably. As he wrote Lewis became more emotionally involved with his world and the writing became more profound. But a gain in reading in chronological order is an awareness of a cosmology beginning with Creation and ending with an Apocalypse. <br><br>On the other hand, if read in publication order, one experiences something of the delight and  surprise that the original readers of the series had as the narrative spotlight illuminated the various Narnian scenes and characters from book to book. <br><br>Of course, it is always possible to read the series both ways. Perhaps experience the publication order first and then sample the effects of a chronological approach.  In the end it is certainly your call. :}<a class="jsHide hideAction" href="#">(less)</a></br></br></br></br></span></span>

<span id="freeText4306545740080882137" style="display:none">My greatest disappointment in <a href="http://www.goodreads.com/review/show/4000436">'The Screwtape Letters'</a> was that Lewis was not able to demonstrate what made his good people good or his bad people bad. The most he said was that believers were suffused with a vague light that even shone in the cat. This book has the same flaw, though the cat is much bigger.<br><br>Aslan had no character, he was just a big, dull stand-in. Lewis often tells us how great he is, but never demonstrates what it is that makes him great or impressive. Sure, he helps the kids, but all that makes him is a plot facilitator. He also has his big Jesus moment, but that has the same problem as the original: if he already knows that there will be no lasting negative outcome, how much of a sacrifice is it, really?<br><br>But then, Aslan isn't based on the original fig-cursing, church-rejecting, rebel Jesus, but the whitewashed version. Like Mickey Mouse, Jesus started out as an oddball troublemaker with his fair share of personality, but becoming the smiling face of a multinational organization bent on world domination takes a lot out of a mascot, whether your magic castle is in California or Rome.<br><br>Such a visible figure must become universally appealing, universally friendly and loving, lest some subset of followers feel left out. And it's this 'Buddy Christ' tradition from which Aslan seems to spring. Devoid of insight, wisdom, or charm, Aslan is just here to do things that our protagonists can't do.<br><br>This also beggars the question: why didn't Aslan just take care of all this stuff long before the kids arrived? Why did all the animals and fairies and giants have to suffer the pain of an endless winter? Except for a vague mention of prophecy, there isn't any reason for Aslan to wait for the kids, since in the end, he does it all on his own, anyways.<br><br>The only thing the kids do is help run of the battle, but this is only necessary because Aslan is absent, and he's only absent because the kids screwed up, indicating that the entire thing would have gone much more smoothly if they had never been there in the first place.<br><br>In that regard, I have to say Lewis did an excellent job boiling down Christianity into a fable, and leaving the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRTS_yM89gE" rel="nofollow">problem of evil</a> completely intact. Some readers suggest that Aslan lets the queen take over to teach the kids a lesson, but is it really worthwhile to let all the inhabitants of a kingdom suffer a century of misery just to teach a few kids about the true meaning of friendship?<br><br>The villain is just as poorly-constructed, and seems less concerned with defeating her enemies than with being pointlessly capricious. She manages to trick one of the children, but instead of taking advantage of this fact, she immediately makes it clear that she tricked him. I mean, how did someone that incompetent take over in the first place?<br><br>Selectively stupid characters are silly and convenient, especially as villains, because this completely undermines their role as foil. It is impressive when characters overcome challenges, but not when challenges simply crumble before them. The children are lucky the Queen was more of a <a href="http://www.pitt.edu/~dash/fart.html#devil" rel="nofollow">fart-stealing Old Nick</a> than a Miltonian Satan, otherwise they never would have stood a chance.<br><br>It is interesting to look at how many Christian authors have tried to reconcile their faith with complex fairy mythologies; not that Christianity doesn't have its own <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book_of_tobit" rel="nofollow">magical fairy tales</a>, but these other traditions are not exactly compatible. Dante has Virgil lead him through hell, the Buddha was <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barlaam_and_Josaphat" rel="nofollow">made into a saint</a>, holidays were given new meanings (even if they often kept <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C4%92ostre" rel="nofollow">old symbols and names</a>), and magical monsters were also given a place in the new faith.<br><br>In the Middle Ages, monks compiled <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beastiary" rel="nofollow">'Bestiaries'</a>, which described the roles of dragons, unicorns, and real animals in Christian synbolism; there were even century-spanning debates about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cynocephaly#Late_Antiquity" rel="nofollow">whether dog-headed men were descended from Adam</a>. These books were rarely accurate, but allowed Christian theology to adopt many stories and superstitions from earlier periods; for instance, the connection between unicorns and virginity or the belief that pelicans fed their own blood to their young, in imitation of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transubstantiation" rel="nofollow">communion</a>.<br><br>So Lewis' attempt to take myth and adapt it to a Christian cosmology is hardly new--there is a long and storied tradition explored throughout the Chivalric period and recognizable today in books like <a href="http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/43545.The_Once_and_Future_King">The Once and Future King</a>, but Lewis doesn't a very good job of reconciling these disparate mythologies.<br><br>Like most Protestants, Lewis' religion was a modern one, not magical and mystical, but reasonable and utilitarian. He did not draw on the elaborate, convoluted apocrypha of hallucinatory monsters and miracles that mystics obsess over, instead, he made a small, sane, reasonable magical world--which rather defeats the point. It is unfortunate that many of today's readers think of Lewis' writings as defining English fairy tales, since his late additions to the genre are not original, nor are they particularly well-executed examples.<br><br>Many authors have come to the genre with much more imagination, a deeper sense of wonder, and a more far-reaching exploration of magic. We have examples from <a href="http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/571197.Puck_of_Pook_s_Hill">Kipling</a>, <a href="http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/24213.Alice_s_Adventures_in_Wonderland_Through_the_Looking_Glass">Lewis Carroll</a>, <a href="http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/14686">Dunsany</a>, <a href="http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13624.The_Worm_Ouroboros">Eddison</a>, <a href="http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/189746">Morris</a>, and even modern updates by <a href="http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16793.Stardust">Gaiman</a> and <a href="http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/14201">Clarke</a>. Lewis, like Tolkien, may be a well-known example, but both are rather short-sighted, and neither one achieves as much as the many talented authors who came before.<br><br>I'm not saying Lewis is bad, merely that he is unremarkable, and is hardly preeminent in fantasy, or even in children's fantasy. However, I do think his fundamental message is a bad one, even if he didn't realize he was creating it. <br><br>In all of his worlds, he takes the sorts of people he dislikes, defines them as 'evil', then sets himself apart from them. There is no attempt to comprehend or to come to mutual understanding. I cannot respect a book which encourages people to vilify what they don't understand and to call isolation righteous. If any worldview deserves the epithet of 'evil', it is the sort of willful, prideful, self-indulgent ignorance Lewis displays.<br><br><a href="http://starsbeetlesandfools.blogspot.com/2012/06/suggested-readings-in-fantasy.html" rel="nofollow">My List of Suggested Fantasy Books</a></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></span>

How was it possible that an English girl could transport herself to another place, simply by hiding in a wardrobe? And once through the wardrobe, there was this wonderful and friendly creature called a faun, Mr Tumnus. All this in only the first chapter.<br>     As the chapters progressed we got to know more about the siblings and the other creatures who inhabit Narnia.<br>     Some people critisize C.S Lewis for using too much Christian symbolism, but I was in 4th grade and to me this was the most wonderful and exciting book ever written for children. <br><br>     When Mr Goodwin finished the book. I instantly went to the library so I could read it myself. I was very proud this was the first book I read "without pictures". To my joy, I discovered there were other books about Narnia and I eventually read all of them too. Evenutually I discovered other wonderful places in other books and I continue to look for them today.<br>     I will always be grateful to Mr Goodwin, he started off by telling me about Narnia, but in the end, he introduced me to so much more through my on going love of books.<br>     Thank you Mr Goodwin, for everything.<br/></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></span>

<span id="freeText508521168420497441" style="display:none"><br><strong>A Defence of C.S. Lewis...or a brief attempt at such</strong><br><br>Some thoughts recently crossed my mind <s>no doubt on their way down-town to relax</s> in regards to arguments one could offer as a defence of the Christian side of this novel. The main arguments against this novel as a 'Christian allegory' that I have heard are: 1)Aslan is not a strong Christ-figure 2)That C.S. Lewis 'preaches' a black and white morality. So I'm going to roughly address them from my perspective and hope it encourages some discussion.<br><br>1) I will agree that Aslan is not a strong Christ-figure. Firstly for Aslan to really represent Christ he would have to be true to the gospel story. In other words he would have to be god made into man come to die for all mankind. However as he only dies for the one traitor again it's not sticking true to the Biblical gospel that all have sinned and that Christ was needed as a sacrifice for that sin. If you take things too literally here, C.S. Lewis' novel doesn't make much that much sense theologically as a result. I'll explain where I am/was going with that in a moment.<br><br>2) I debate that C.S. Lewis preaches in his novel. Occasionally he can be a touch patronising but compared to many authors he rarely slips into such condescension. As for his morality I think you must understand it from the perspective of Christianity. Christianity is about black and white morality essentially: good versus evil, light vs. dark and truth vs. lies etc. It is also very grey in that Christianity is about life and the fact that no one is perfect, that everyone fits into that moral grey area. Of course I explain roughly and inadequately.<br><br>Ultimately I see that there is room to argue that C.S. Lewis does a poor job of writing an allegorical novel. However I see it as a very subtle novel that unlike others (for instance The Alchemist) does not build its story around expressing an ideology but rather incorporates an ideology into its storytelling. I think that if one wants to criticise this novel it should be for not properly showing the gospel rather than for 'preaching'. I know that I and many others enjoyed the story first before seeing the connection between it and the Biblical tales. I enjoyed it even more afterwards so, then again I could be a tad biased.<br><br><strong>Original Review</strong><br><br>To begin I must note that I grant this such a high rating due to the impact it had on my life. It to me is one novel that were I to pick the one novel that forged a love of books for me it would be The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe. Why? Because I can remember back about twelve years ago when I was homeschooled by my mother as a five year old. We wandered down during winter into the warm back room and she read the first Narnia book to us. The image of a red faun carrying parcels as he passed a growing lamppost would stick with me from that moment (as it stuck with C.S. Lewis). As I learned to read the Narnia books were the first novels I sunk my growing reading teeth into. And to this day I have read and re read the novels back to front (and maybe front to back).<br><br>The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe is a novel written for both children and adults. It contains highly allegorical elements as C.S.Lewis was a well-known apologetics writer. However he wrote that he did not write his novel as a pure allegory but as a story. And that is what The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe is, a story to be enjoyed by everyone. And although written in simple language the reader can quickly, concisely and easily imagine the world without the clumsy constraints of overused words. I personally cannot imagine a world without these novels.<br><br>Additional thoughts:<br><br>1. Just a question at last. And one with a highly philosophical twist to it. Why is it that people so readily condemn those books which are considered as moral tales? You'd think we could do with more morality in such a twisted and confused world regardless of accepting the belief systems. <br><br>2. I have heard many people describe the entire series as silly and far too preachy. I do not see it that way at all. Trust me if C.S.Lewis wanted to be preachy he would have written a lot more philosophy and less story. Yes I can see how some would call this silly but then I argue that they are missing the point. It's a fairytale type fantasy intended mainly for children (and for those children again as adults or for their parents perhaps). But I argue that as Lewis only wrote this story based on the story of the crucifixion in many ways that it was not intended as a preachy book. My question is that why is it that if I were to base a story along what some call the 'Christian myth' it is claimed as preaching while as if I were to base it on any other mythology or story it would be deemed as merely copying the themes of another mythology? Is this yet another example of doublethink?*<br><br>*See <a href="http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/5470.1984" title="1984 by George Orwell">1984</a> (yes go and read it - you'll get what I mean)</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></span>

I think if we didn't call him a representation of God but rather a moral conscience or something along those lines it would not be condemned as such even if the story remains the same. honestly most children aren't reading the stories to understand the philosophical meaning but rather have a good time</span>

Even though he had just betrayed them and was causing grief they didn't mistreat or disown him. <br>*The very mention of Aslan's name caused certain positive feelings to come over them all  they didn't know why.  But it made Edmund feel guilty.<br>*After Ed was returned and his siblings saw him for the first time Aslan said, "Here is your brother and there's no need to talk about what's in the past."  They forgave their brother. Aslan neither excused him nor condemned him.<br>*They all knew better than to go into a wardrobe &amp; shut the door as the book mentions a whole bunch of times.  We regularly do things when we know better.<br>*The professor makes them think and questions their disbelief in Lucy's story.  This is something the movie totally leaves out.  "Who would you usually believe, Lucy or Edmund?" etc.  Edmund shows the worst side of human nature, to betray &amp; let others down.<br>*I love that Father Christmas comes giving gifts that represent the gifts &amp; talents we each have to help others with and to overcome evil with.<br>There's more but I have to go!

With his goat like legs and general caprine features you might be forgiven for imagining that he might be an agent of Satan, or Pan or some other pagan deity. Nope.

Ruled in supremely effective manner by single minded, highly organised, independent woman until arrival of children and large pet. Maybe this book is actually a metaphor for home life in the modern age.<br><br/></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></span>

I think my liking for her carried over from the movie – yes, I saw the movie first and I never read this as a kid – but for the most part, she was still pretty awesome in the book. <br><br>Well... sort of. Lewis kind of brags about Aslan a bit... or ... a lot... all the time, so the White Witch gets made fun of. I know some of you might say, well, it's a kids book, and for children at the time, they were  really careful on what went into the books and how frightening or sad it was. Lewis doesn't shut up about it either, he mentions it a few times. Like, oh, I would show you this, or I would tell you this, but if I did, believe me, you wouldn’t be allowed to read this book. <br><br>So... I understand that he might've felt the need to portray Aslan as very strong and mighty even when he was shown as weak, and to give the impression that everything is going to be okay – for the children, you know? But for me, and I'm not a kid, it's ... not so fun and gets boring because all the suspense is gone. <br><br>Maybe that's why I really liked the Witch. She brought with her a kind of ... evilness, and power, and she's a woman and she's ruling. I don't care if she's not supposed to, she's pretty awesome and she's feared. <br><br>In the movie, she seemed really, really proud to me, and I liked that. I kind of imagined her like that in the book too, but then Lewis gives us this: <br><em>"Haa-a-arrh!" roared Aslan, half rising from his throne; and his great mouth opened wider and wider and the roar grew louder and louder, and the Witch, after staring for a moment with her lips wide apart, <strong>picked up her skirts and fairly ran for her life.</strong> </em><br><br>No, please. She may not have her wand, but I don't think she would 'pick up her skirts and [run] for her life' – that's just not like her. Yeah, yeah, it's Lewis's character, and what do I know, but seriously people, authors always screw up their characters without noticing. I believe this is just  to show us that the Mighty Aslan is feared by all, and if that the Witch is scared of him, yay everything will be okay. <br><br>I also don't like the idea that she's shown as 'all bad' – like, she's entirely evil just because she's half jinn and half giant. (Yes, yes, it's a children's book, and the evil guy is just evil and needs to die – but let's ignore that for a few moments.)<br><br>I'd heard all about how this book is full of Christian themes and ideas, but 'jinn' are not Christian, are they? I don't think they are. <br><br>Let me tell you about jinn.<br><br>In Islam, there are humans, angels, and jinn. The humans were made of earth/clay/mud/whatever you prefer calling it, the angels were made of light, and the jinn were made of fire. <br>Out of the three creatures, only the angels are pure and are created to obey only. They do not, or <strong>
<em>cannot</em>
</strong> commit <em>any</em> sins. So there are no such things as fallen angels. Angels remain angels, and they are powerful creatures that serve god. <br><br>Both humans and jinn, however, have free will. They can choose either good are bad, and they have both good and evil inside them. Satan, the devil, is a jinn. He was thrown down to Earth because he defied god, and his promise to him was that by the time the Day of Judgement arrives, he'll lead as many people in to hell as he can. <br><br>In <em>A Thousand and One Nights</em>, or <em>Arabian Nights</em> – whichever version you know of, jinns are portrayed as both good and evil. The good ones are called 'faeries/fairies' I think, in the English translation. I don't know what the real Arabic version calls them, but if I ever get my hands on it, I'll let you know. Anyways, the bad jinn are called just... jinn, I think, and they are the followers of Iblis – which is just the name of the Devil. <br><br>What I'm trying to say is, that just like humans, the jinn have both good and bad. They can be evil, and they can be good. So when the Beavers tell the children that the White Witch is <em>all bad</em> and has no good in her because she's half jinn and half giant, being the daughter of Lilith, my reaction was, “Excuse me?” <br><br>There is no Lilith in Islam, and I'm not very sure about giants – though I do think they appear in <em>A Thousand and One Nights</em>, but they might be some way associated to jinn? -- but if she's part jinn then she has SOME GOOD IN HER DAMMIT. <br><br>Lewis burrowed all sorts of things with his giants and tree spirits and all of that, but come on. Why would you just take this 'jinn' and insert it into your story, just because? I know as a writer he's free to take whatever he wants, but that just doesn't make sense at all if we're looking at it from how Islam views jinn. <br><br>Then there's her name. The <em>White</em> Witch. Why is she the <em>White</em> Witch? If she is really all bad, why pick the color white? Isn't that 'pureness, innocence, clean' and a whole bunch of other 'good' things in the West? I guess you can say it's because the winter, or the ice, but hey, there are other colors too. There's blue, there's gray – or he could just not go with color at all! He could call her the Ice Witch, the Winter Witch, the Snow Witch – I don't know!<br><br>We talked about this in class too. Like, why white? So I said, well, she's half jinn. That was when I didn't know that there were no such things as jinn in Christianity. And they were like, is jinn white? <br><br>I don't really know, but if I were to pick a color for jinn, it would be white. I even went home and asked my mother, and she answered 'white' automatically, without even thinking about it. Maybe it's because in Islam, jinn are beings that live among our world, but mind their business if you mind your business. Maybe think of them as spirits, or ghosts (hate to call them ghosts but just for now). They're invisible to you though, so white just... makes sense. Maybe it's some influence of Eastern culture on me that I'm not aware of... but yes, a lady jinn... white fits her. <br><br>So I just cannot see her as someone who is entirely bad or evil. She's half jinn, she's given the color white, and to me, this woman had some reason for doing what she's doing. I know in the story, it's definitely NO WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT DID YOU EVEN READ but could Lewis have done a better job with her?<br><br>Uh, yeah. <br>Come on, jinn are <em>fascinating</em>. <br><br>You know what, I think I'll write something about jinn someday. Someday. <br><br>I swear I had more to say about her... but moving on.<br><br>Aslan. <br><br>His character is okay till around the part he gets sacrificed. <br>Oh, wait. No, that's not it.<br>It's when he gets reborn.<br>No...<br>That's not it either. <br><br>Oh yeah. <br>It's when he starts chasing the girls and goes yaaaay I'm a kitty come play with me tickle  me can I hug you yaaaaaayyy – oh shit. Girls, we've got a war going on, and we have some saving to do. Stop fooling around and get on my back, we gonna go rescuing. <br><br>Ah... hah... ha...<br><br>No, seriously. Does anyone understand what happened there? I think Lewis was trying to make Aslan NOT seem like the Christ figure, so he inserted that silly and completely out of character scene in there. I mean, he gets sacrificed for protecting a boy, for the greater good, don't you see him as a Christ Figure?<br><br>It's like Lewis went, oh crap. This dude's a lion, everyone's going to talk about this now and people would hate me for it.<br><br>Or I should ask, is it okay to compare animals to humans? I don't really know much about Christianity, so I guess I can't talk much about that.<br><br>But Aslan, buddy, when you roared everyone ran the fuck away, why are you suddenly acting like a little baby? It might've worked a little better if we saw Aslan acting more... childlike with the arrival of the kids, so suddenly coming back to life and playing around a bit would have been there in his character. <br><br>Wait, wait, actually, no. No. Even if you say like, oh, it's like a whole rebirth thing, and he's all young and full of energy now – do you not realize that <em>there's a war going on?</em> They just fool around for like, <em>hours</em>, and suddenly it's all business.<br><br>That makes NO sense. If Lewis had shown him as a more happy/fun loving character with the kids before, it still would've been really, really stupid of him to waste hours just chasing around the girls. And if you say, well, when he played around, he was RIGHT on time for everything else that happened -- still, no. It's a book. You can write it a billion ways and make it work -- but this does not work. <br><br>No wonder they cut that out in the movie. It's completely stupid. <br><br>Okay, finally to Susan. <br><br>I think I mentioned something about the essay I had to write when I was reading this book. So that essay turned into a comparison between this and <em>Alice's Adventures in Wonderland.</em> It was about culture, war, society, and... something. I don't know. But I talked a bit about why this or that was not included, so I'll skip most of that here. There's one important question left though:<br><br>Why was Susan given a freaking bow and arrow? <br>Why was Lucy given a knife?<br>Why was Susan, who was older than Edmund, not participating in the war with her freaking amazing bow which NEVER MISSES? <br>Why would you give someone something that they never end up using?<br>Why would you send the younger child to war? Why not send two of the older ones, and leave two of the younger ones to get a little closer? Edmund treated Lucy like shit, don't you think if Edmund and Lucy spent time together during that Aslan-is-getting-sacrificed bit, they'd get to know each other better? More bonding time! Or is it because one's a guy, and the other a girl, they wouldn't like to be in each other's company?<br><br><s>ohthat'snotONEquestionsorry</s><br><br>What is the reason for Edmund being such an ass? <br><br>I think the movie did a better job with this. If I remember right, he was all grouchy and mean because he missed his daddy--or both his parents? I'm not sure, but because of the war, that makes a ton of sense.<br><br>So why does Susan have such an amazing weapon if SHE DOES NOT USE IT? She uses it in the movie, so that was good. <br><br>But really, you have something that will strike anything you aim for, and... you don't use it? It just makes no sense. Why is that amazing weapon in this book?<br><br>Oh, but this is only one book, what do I know about the rest of the series? <br><br>I asked! AND THEY TOLD ME SHE DOESN'T DO ANY ARCHERY AND SHE DOESN'T KICK ANY ASS.<br><br>And you know, that's okay. It would be fine if Susan and Lucy were both shown as the characters who were more ... caretakers, supporters, helpers instead of fighters, but... <em>why giver her the freaking bow?</em><br><br>What's that there for? Lucy is given a dagger, and told to use it only when she really needs to. A little kid given a dagger, in a time of war, told it's dangerous and <em>only</em> to use when she <em>has</em> to. All right, I understand. She doesn't use it, and I understand. She didn't need to. Instead that potion... healing thing was more important.<br><br>But SUSAN. She's given a horn to blow when she needs help, and she's given an amazing freaking weapon. She uses the horn, but not that amazing weapon.<br><br>I feel sorry for that weapon. I really do. It's like if I buy chocolate, and I never eat it. What a waste. <br><br>Think about it a little though. If Susan had practiced a bit, she might've even saved Aslan from getting sacrificed. Maybe she could've hid in the shadows and fired an arrow at the White Witch or something. Oh, but there was no need, you say? Aslan was fine? <br><br>So? Are you just going to ignore the fact that one of the characters has an amazing weapon, just so it doesn't mess with your plot? And think about how awesome she would've been if she <em>did</em> take part in the war! Just standing on some hill, firing arrows right and left, hitting everything and everyone. <br><br>Imagine it for a second.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></img></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></span>

Additionally, I love the role Aslan plays in this book because I think the ultimate sacrifice that he chooses to make shows how innately good he is. Even though this book is an easy read for me now at 18, this is one of those kinds of stories that you can never grow too old for. I really liked the line C.S. Lewis wrote in his dedication: "But some day you will be old enough to start reading fairy tales again." Isn't that the truth? Overall, I'd definitely have to call this a classic that everyone should read at some point or another. </span>

This is a fairy tale, with dwarfs and witches and animals that can speak. You can either be enchanted if you let go of your practical mindset, or disenchanted if you approach it as a jaded adult that can only grasp reality and adult situations. Obviously,  C.S. Lewis is not your thing, and I am not going to debate that, but I strongly disagree with you when you say that his writing is mediocre at best.  That's not even a matter of opinion in that case, is writing is far from mediocre, I am dumbfounded by that comment of yours!</span>

Aslan was just... ugh, completely two dimensional in his perfection, and so smug and arrogant. He was <em>unbearable</em>. I enjoyed the fantasy, but the element that I now realise (and am astonished that I ever didn't realise) is the Christian allegory made me scornful of the character who was supposed to be the supreme 'goody' and left a bitter taste in my mouth that ultimately ruined it. I enjoyed other books in the series more, some more than others (enjoyment increased exponentially as Aslan's involvement decreased), but this one was the worst.</span>

<span id="freeText10816284203308581400" style="display:none">The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe by CS Lewis is one of the books in his series, the Chronicles of Narnia in which Christianity is portrayed through various fantasy creatures. God, for instance is portrayed as a talking Lion. What a wonderful series! What child hasn’t climbed into a closet and explored the back cracks in hope of finding an entrance to a new and exciting world after reading this book? I used to sit in a closet with the door closed and a flashlight reading my favorite books after reading this series, in hopes that someday a door would open and take me to another realm. Of course, the white witch is my favorite character. I’m always attracted to the bad ones. The Lion, Aslan, is a wonderful character as well, but I have to admit, knowing that he was an analogy for God, changed my view of the story a bit and left me a bit disappointed. He was a bit cheesy. Or maybe typical is a better word. Which is why I almost wish I wouldn’t have known the true meaning of the books until after I read them. <br><br>In any case, the stories were great, the first one being the best. (You always lose a little of the naiveté of the children as they get older) But the movies did them justice as well. Reading them again as an adult, found me a little bored, but still enchanted overall with the series. The next movie is due out soon and I can only hope they will continue to make the movies which were incredible. I highly recommend this series and consider it a classic as well.<br><br>Note: I've recently started these again with my 5 yr old and we are loving it.  I get to see it again through a child's eyes.  And this time I haven't told him anything about the analogy to Christianity, however I do point out certain lessons such as forgiveness.  (When Aslan has his talk with Edmund)  I want him to figure it out on his own.  We had a popcorn movie night and watched the movie together curled up under a blanket a few days ago and as I sat there, I thought to myself, this is why I had children.  To experience all my favorite things over again through a child's eyes.  It was the best time.<br><br><a href="http://classicsdefined.com/narnia.html" rel="nofollow"> ClassicsDefined.com</a><br><br/></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></span>

<span id="freeText14741096342840768751" style="display:none">While I first read this book in the mid-70s, I read it again to my wife a couple of years ago (we both loved it then as much as I did the first time).  Most people know that C. S. Lewis was an effective Christian nonfiction apologist, using the tools of reason and logic to build the philosophical case for Christian faith.  But he ultimately became convinced that an even more effective apologetic is available through the "truth of art," the instinctive and emotional appeal that stories exert -- especially the kinds of stories that draw on the deep, mythical archetypes of fantasy to illuminate the real universe.  The Chronicles of Narnia, his classic fantasy series, was the fruit of that discovery, set in Narnia, a magical land whose world lies in another universe, in which magic works and time moves differently than it does here, and in which Christ is incarnate as the great talking lion Aslan.  This first book of the series presents one of the most powerful symbolic literary presentations of the Christian gospel ever written.  Although the intended audience, in Lewis' mind, was children (and his author's various direct addresses to the readers presuppose this), there is nothing invidiously "juvenile" about the quality of the writing; it can be enthusiastically appreciated by anyone who loves tales of imagination and adventure, fantasy and wonder; and the truths here, like those in Jesus' parables, are simple enough to speak to children but profound enough to challenge adults.<br><br>This is the "first" book of the series in the sense of first to be written (and usually the first to be read).  However, The Magicians Nephew is a prequel which describes the creation of Narnia, and the origins of the White Witch and of the wardrobe that serves as a gateway to Narnia; Lewis himself recommended that this prequel be read first.</br></br></span>

I hear the seventh one is coming out this summer. I think they are better than Narnia, but that's just my opinion.

<span id="freeText12568317345654338140" style="display:none">During my freshman year at Grinnell College we had resident advisors, a couple who lived downstairs in Loose Hall dorm who were there if we needed them.  That never happened, but they were friendly and welcoming, their door usually open to visitors.  My roommate, Richard Hyde, had some relationship with them and invited me to join him for a visit.<br><br>Skip and Flo were Christians! That was intriguing.  I asked them about it and they gave me an answer which I only came to understand years later, after I'd read Schweitzer and Bultmann.  It basically amounted to their agreeing that, yes, Christianity was absurd and that the core of it was Christ crucified.  Not the resurrection.  That's absurd.  Christ crucified.  --At least, that's the way I constructively interpreted these nice people four years later when I actually had come to know quite a lot about their religion.<br><br>They also loaned me a copy of Lewis' children's book, The Lion etc., first volume of his Narnia series, presumably because I'd mentioned having read and liked his Perelandra Trilogy and autobiography.  <br><br>Dutifully, I gave it a try...and hated it.  Now, as an adult of sorts, having also read and despised his Screwtape Letters, I could see through the story to the underlying propaganda and it bothered me a lot that children were intended to be exposed to it.  Still, they were nice people.  I suffered through the thing out of respect for them.<br><br>Now, reflecting on my own early exposure to, and appreciation of, C.S. Lewis, I am less prone to be upset.  I survived the insidious brainwashing.  It appears my fourteen year old niece has managed to do so in recent years as well.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></span>

However (and there is a big 'however'), I just couldn't get past the whole lectured-in-church feeling that this book produced. <br>Don't get me wrong, I am a religious person, and I believe in Christ with all my heart. But, I personally get a lot more out of reading scriptures about him than this allegorical fantasy. So, if Lewis had allowed it to be a layered thing, ya know, enjoy the story, and if you see the parellels to Christ and his mission, good for you, I would have enjoyed it a lot more. As it was, I felt like every other paragraph was practically screaming at me, "Get it?? You Get IT?? The LION, came back to LIFE!!" Yeah, we got it.<br>I read Prince Caspian because I was curious about the rest of the story, but I'm done. It was a little too much for me, and I'll just stick to my scriptures, rather than talking lions.</br></br></br></br></span>

<span id="freeText18051914755529661658" style="display:none">Regardless of the anyone's critical opinion, <em>The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe</em> is one of the most memorable pieces of fantastic literature ever produced (completely disregarding the pop culture influence). Its simple premise, reticulated with a vast allegorically fantastical world remains an incredibly effective method of storytelling, as its themes and concepts still resonate today.<br><br>The premise of the story is relatively straightforward; four young children are moved to the countryside to avoid a war torn London, and are arbitrarily <em>(or so it may seem)</em> entangled into the affairs of another world. However, this isn't just some escape for the young children. Ironically, in avoiding the conflict that afflicts their home, they become the key turning point in another, more elaborate struggle.<br><br>It progresses in a manner that leaves the reader wondering why they even bother assisting in this vast nearly improbable endeavour, but like any great story, it becomes so palpably apparent without resorting to brazenfaced exposition. His ideas are presented mysteriously, oftentimes are aspects of Narnia hinted or implied, even the grander aspects are enigmatic. They are influenced greatly by the Christian (and other mythological) allusions presented in the novel. <br><br>This struggle oftentimes showcases common Christian themes such as temptation, faith, betrayal and sacrifice; all of which are basically touted, but unequivocally pertinent to the story. They reveal both the strengths and weaknesses of the four children, their callowness and their ripening. These themes grasp  the cast of side characters as well, who are as distinguished as they are intriguing. They are not defined but developed by these themes.<br><br>Mr. Tumnus, perhaps woven from the story's most infamous image, typifies the challenges of these themes, as do both Aslan and Edmund. Some brush it off as brash allegory, but I see it as a clever, and an even more accessible envisioning of topics which were otherwise bombastic in the hands of overzealous vicars. They were presented as choices, not duties and still preserved the Christian virtue that Lewis still closely follows.   <br><br>So this novel isn't merely a simple piece of fantasy. As familiar themes and concepts are weaved, the story becomes ultimately original. And though C.S. Lewis is very much a religiously devout man, his allusions are presented more passionately than piously. He sprouts truth through fantasy, and at the same time creates an entertaining story.<br><br>Though the oddities of this quasi-fairytale novel are quite tame in comparison to Eddison or Carroll, I think The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe remains an effulgent presence in the genre. His tale of heroism, his contemporary style blended with a high fantasy splendour both succeeded in telling an entertaining story that didn't falter under heavy themes and concepts. It was both undone and unheard of at the time of its release. <br><br>Of course, The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe holds heavy influence on contemporary works today especially considering the blend of Earth-dwellers placed in high fantastical situations. Thankfully the novel isn't worn with age. Its immensity and broadly-thematic tale remain as rich and accessible as any contemporary fantasy work today. It also remains a model for works of this ilk. Lewis transcends the whims and expectations of contemporary fantasy, and the banality of heroic fantasy. <br><br>This, more than any other book, holds sentimental value. It was my ingress to fantasy (even preceding The Lord of the Rings and Harry Potter). And the best part is that this novel is more important to me now than ever, as my keenness on fantasy rises so does my reverence for The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe. The subtle aspects becomes clearer, as do the themes and the allegory. It is, irrevocably, an important piece of fantastic literature.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></span>

<span id="freeText17898067072407814481" style="display:none"><em>"Same here. It's a childhood love. It's nice to see someone write something positive about Narnia for a change! So many people shoot it down for its religious themes--I don't quite see why."</em><br><br>I was also surprised at the amount of people who disliked this novel. I guess the Christian Allegory was the most potent instigator but one must remember that the book is not simply revered for being an infamous Christian allegory. <br><br>I was around 8 or 9 when I read this novel and the Christian allegories flew over my head. When I found out the story was built on Christian allegory, I'll admit because it's built from a religion I don't follow, I was a bit flustered. But I realized the Christian allegory didn't really ruin the story. Neil Gaiman's views are quite similar to my own, as he says:<br><blockquote>"My upset was, I think, that it made less of Narnia for me, it made it less interesting a thing, less interesting a place. Still, the lessons of Narnia sank deep. Aslan telling the Tash worshippers that the prayers he had given to Tash were actually prayers to Him was something I believed then, and ultimately still believe."</blockquote><br><blockquote>"I think, perhaps, the genius of Lewis was that he made a world that was more real to me than the one I lived in; and if authors got to write the tales of Narnia, then I wanted to be an author."</blockquote><br><em>Lit Bug wrote: "I need to read this! "</em><br><br>It's a classic that should be read by anyone wanting to get into fantasy (whether you like it or dislike it, actually). And yes, it's children's lit. You'll probably notice a lot of Christian allegory, I would advise not ignoring it, and just make of it what you will. I for one loved how it's based into the story, and while C.S. Lewis isn't the most intellectual supporter of Christianity, no one can deny his passion.<br><br><em>"I saw the movies and especially liked the first in the series :)"</em><br><br>I saw the film as well, I don't plan on watching the sequels until I read the books first.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></span>

<span id="freeText4386833002022006132" style="display:none">Rather than spend this review explaining what I thought of the book, I will instead devote my time to justifying placing this on my "the movie is better" shelf.<br><br>Reasons the Movie Version Is Better:<br>1. Watching it will take about the same amount of time it takes to read the book, because good lord does everything get wrapped up quick.<br>2. We actually get to see some real fight scenes, and even though there's no blood and it's all very PG, at least it's not just "There was a battle going on but then Aslan showed up and it was over yay!" <br>3. The dialogue is considerably less dated and irritating. The kids in the book speak like plummy old British men watching a cricket match in 1800: "'We've fallen on our feet and no mistake,' said Peter. 'This is going to be perfectly splendid. That old chap will let us do anything we like.'" <br>Meanwhile, the movie has lines like this: "When Adam's Flesh and Adam's bone sits at Cair Paravel in throne, the evil time will be over and done." "You know that doesn't really rhyme." <br>4. Aslan becomes much less of a dick when he's voiced by Liam Neeson. <br>5. Since the book is so short (see Reason 1) there's plenty of time for the film to do justice to everything in C.S. Lewis's material, and even add some things. For instance, did you know the Pevensie kids actually have a mother? With a <em>face</em>? Shocking, I know. <br>6. William Mosely is a pretty, pretty boy. Peter the Magnificent, indeed.<br><br>DON'T YOU JUDGE ME. <br><a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0608440/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0608440/</a></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></span>

Around 12 or 13, I also read <em>The Lord of the Rings</em>, for example, and I have read it innumerable times now and continue to enjoy it every once in a while.<br><br>Now, I’m not sure if I believe this premise or not, but in <em>The End of Your Life Book Club</em> by Will Schwalbe, his mother had a theory—we are all either Narnia fans or Middle Earth fans.  In her experience, people rarely loved both fantasy worlds.  She and one child were Narnia people and her son Will inhabited Middle Earth in a way that both of them envied.<br><br>Reading <em>The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe</em> now as an adult well into middle age, I find the Christian symbolism in it to be obvious and heavy handed.  (Mind you, if you had little exposure to Christianity, I’m sure many parts of the story line would be inexplicable!)  By contrast, although many people say they see similar things in Tolkien, I seem to be blind to it.  Yes, there is a struggle between good and evil, but it doesn’t seem to me to be a particularly Christian world or world view and <em>The Lord of the Rings</em> certainly doesn’t clobber you with Christianity the way than Lewis’ work does. (In fact, LOTR feels very pagan to me).<br><br>I guess this is my way of saying if the world really does split itself evenly into Team Narnia and Team Middle Earth, count me in as a member of Team Middle Earth.  Despite the fact that I quite enjoyed the fantasy adventure, the Greek mythological beings (fauns, centaurs, dryads, etc.), plus the references to Northern European mythology (the Witch seems to be to be a relative of the Snow Queen, and Father Christmas has become a regular everywhere).  Mind you, it also seems to me to be a bit unfair to compare definite children’s literature (Narnia) with a book that I began enjoying as a tween and that continues to comfort me now in my 5th decade (LOTR).<br><br>I certainly see why this book has become a classic and why it still appeals to children today.  <br><br/></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></span>

I can't remember exactly what she told me of them, but I do remember my eyes. They were so large, I figure anyone who watched me might've thought they would jump out of their sockets.

<span id="freeText3767024124661997858" style="display:none">Unlike some who re-read "The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe" as adults and bring their fond childhood memories to the experience, I barely remember reading it the first time, when I was quite young. So, reading it now, I'm judging it solely as an adult would. And while some children's books fare incredibly well when read by adults -- even those adults who never read them as children -- C.S. Lewis's book, I'm sorry to say, is not one of them.<br><br>"Lion" is not a bad book, to be sure, but its characters, especially the humans, are a bit bland to stick with the reader once the book is closed. The exception is Edmund Pevensie, who is memorable only because Lewis makes him so unrelentingly obnoxious for almost the entire book. Lewis also draws on myriad old myths, fables and legends to create the hodgepodge that is Narnia, creating little from scratch -- a criticism also leveled at J.K. Rowling decades later. The plot of "Lion" is a bit creaky, too, with some machinations making little sense on their own, and needed solely to keep the story moving forward. I'm thinking, for example, of the note left behind at Mr. Tumnus's house after he is arrested -- a note that exists only so that the Pevensie children can find out what became of the faun.<br><br>But some of the touches in Lewis's writing remain fresh almost 60 years after the book was written. Lewis never lets you forget he's telling you a story, occasionally interjecting his own opinions of the characters' doings, and more than once reminding the reader of something that happened in "the last chapter." Also, now and again, he directly addresses the reader as "you," as would a parent trying to draw a child into a story.<br><br>What else makes "Lion" intersting to the adult reader? Well, there is, late in the book, some hot girl-on-girl-on-lion action. Sure, C.S. Lewis mostly was writing a religious parable for children, but he threw in some thinly veiled steaminess for his adult readers too. Don't think I don't know what you were doing, Jack. I do.<br><br>Also, spoiler alert: Aslan is totally Jesus Christ.<br><br>OK, on to "Prince Caspian."</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></span>

He has a special rather uncomfortable resonance for me since "Narnia" was apparently based on the hills that lie above our small town of Holywood in N Ireland. I suppose I don't share his theology (I'm not a Christian, but Lewis's Christianity seems to be decidedly peculiar) or his prejudices. Perhaps he is too much a man of the 1940s and 1950s which I still recall, and still dislike. Each to his (or her)own. </span>

Often I come back to childhood favorites and they're like comfort food; I could read them again and again.  However, I was not so taken with Narnia on my return visit.  The storytelling is not that amazing, and the characters are frustratingly transparent vehicles for Lewis's real objective, which is the retelling of the Passion of the Christ.  Plus there's an excessive and annoying degree of anthropomorphizing (OK, so the animals must be able to talk in order for the story to go forward, but must the beavers wear snowboots and Aslan the lion stand on two feet?).<br>The central question for me, however, is how useful such an imaginative allegory can possibly be.  I guess CS Lewis can thumb his nose at me for this question, though, since people are still reading the Chronicles of Narnia and still making movies not only about Aslan but also human versions of the Passion of Christ.</br></span>

It's not that I'm reading it in different editions, there's just no way to record multiple read dates... Oh well.<br><br>I used to love this book the most of the whole series. It's magical, and Aslan is such a prominent part of it, and of course it's the book that makes every child check in their wardrobe hopefully. Actually, I still wish I could believe that -- one of my housemates has a most excellent deep wardrobe that would be a very good passage to Narnia. Narnia still feels quite real to me, in this book, because the four kids are so very ordinary to begin with. It feels like anyone could become a king or queen in Narnia.<br><br>Anyway, obviously I'm massively biased about this book, because it's one of the first books I remember reading as a child, and I adored it then. I always used to read it when I was sick -- or if I was too sick to sit up, I'd watch the animated movie from my vantage-point of being draped over the sofa.<br><br>My mother always says that it was something of a toss-up whether Tolkien and C.S. Lewis created Middle-earth and Narnia, or whether it could've happened the other way round. (She also adds that she likes both, but would prefer Tolkien's, whichever one that happened to be.) I don't know about that, knowing about their religious and philosophical beliefs and how they differed, but I can very much see their influence on each other. </br></br></br></br></br></br></span>

I just thought it was a great story. The bit about Aslan allowing himself to be killed, and then coming back to life, seemed, I don't know, <em>illogical</em>... was all this stuff about the Deep Magic and the Emperor over the Sea necessary? It didn't seem to add much to the plot. But the tear-drenched scene with Susan and Lucy keeping guard over Aslan's dead body was effective, as was the resurrection. And it felt good to see how surprised the Witch was when he unexpectedly turned up at the battle. So maybe it wasn't such a bad idea after all. <br><br>The book certainly had many strong points. Finding a magic doorway in a wardrobe was <em>cool</em>, as was the idea that time would pass at different rates in different worlds. I loved the preposterous tea-party at Mr. Tumnus's house. Even at age 9, I could see that the sardines and cake needed a lot of explanation, but it was funny. I had similar feelings about Mrs. Beaver's sewing machine and Father Christmas and his sack of presents. (Come on. How is hiding their breakfast tray in there?) The White Witch was a satisfactory baddie, as was Maugrim. And the Turkish Delight. <em>Everyone</em> enjoys the bit with the Turkish Delight. My own kids were fascinated by it when they were small, and disappointed when they tried real Turkish Delight and found it was nothing special.<br><br>I still sort of like the book, even though I now feel a bit annoyed that he is trying to manipulate me. But enough of the time he's forgetting to preach and just having fun letting the story go where it wants to go, so I forgive him. Maybe he did teach me some Christian virtues after all :)</br></br></br></br></br></span>

<strong>The Land Beyond the Wardrobe</strong><br>(A Book Review of C. S. Lewis’s <em>The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe</em>)</br></blockquote><br><br>One is never too old to appreciate a good story; this can never be truer when I opened the pages of C. S. Lewis’s beloved classic, <em>The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe</em>, inviting me in to the magical world of The Chronicles of Narnia.<br><br>Admittedly, the book was never introduced to me when I was a child or even in any of my high school reading. It is only when I watched Disney’s wonderful movie adaptation where it came to my attention that it was based on a book. Still, it had taken a number of years before I had actually read it along with the whole series. Do I lament the fact that this was not a part of and came into my life way past my childhood or even when I’m too old (but not actually) to be called a teen? I believe a book chooses the reader when one is ready to receive it, and it comes in such a propitious time of one’s life.<br><br>Taken as it is one can easily enjoy <em>The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe</em> (from here on out referred to as LWW for convenience’s sake) as a simple adventure and fairy tale of brothers and sisters Peter, Susan, Edmund, and Lucy Pevensie who one day discovers a wardrobe that acts as a bridge into a mystical land called Narnia. Lewis populates this enchanted landscape with talking animals and creatures inspired from legend and mythology like fauns, minotaurs, dwarfs, centaurs, giants and Father Christmas, to name just a few, that adds to the delight of young and adult readers. At the heart of the book’s plot is a quest that concerns the Penvensies, a prophecy they must fulfill to right wrongs along with the coming of Aslan, king of kings, to bring an end to the hundred-year reign of the White Witch and her evil spell that placed Narnia in a never-ending winter.<br><br>Those above along with magic, treachery, sacrifice and the battle pitting Aslan’s army against the White Witch’s hordes are some of the elements of the story I strongly responded to when I saw the film and still are when I subsequently read the book. Yet other than conjuring a fantastic yarn for the enjoyment of the readers there is more than that meets the eye in LWW.<br><br>What I think draw the initiates and enthusiasts alike to Lewis’s masterpiece repeatedly is that LLW is more than its story, as one intending to dig deep within its plot can discover for themselves a treasure trove of lessons. Indeed, it incorporates Christian allusions and symbols that at first glance is already obvious—much to the chagrin of its adult readers—yet the author handles it with grace and he isn’t heavy handed with the message of his book for we are already disarmed by the charming voice of the narrator. As smooth as snow the story draws us in, so much so that the fluidity of Lewis’s underlying narrative manages to communicate in us gems of lessons in faith, reason, as well as moral truth with us being not quite aware of it at first.<br><br>As humans there is built in us a trait, whether we be aware of it or not, a deep-seated natural ability to determine truth on a subconscious and emotional level and be attracted to it. This I believe is what C. S. Lewis taps into, that’s why for generations now readers of <em>The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe</em> (and all of the books in <em>The Chronicles of Narnia</em>) are easily drawn it; that with Lewis’s pen we are not only touched by the aesthetics of a tale well told, it is to experience, too, the hand of the divine.<br><br>_________________________<br>Book Details: Book <strong>#39</strong> for 2011<br>Published by Harper Collins<br>(Hardcover, November 2009 First Printing)<br>176 pages<br>Read in:  September 03, 2011<br>My Rating: ★ ★ ★ ★ ★<br><br>[See this review on my book blog <a href="http://wp.me/p14wAA-nl" rel="nofollow">

(Some of the side comments made me laugh out loud.)  He successfully manages to blend humor, adventure, mystery, and excitement, all the while paralleling the most important event in all of mankind.  Interestingly enough, the entire parallel of The Atonement and The Resurrection lasts only 2 chapters.  My favorite part of the book is when Lucy and Susan follow Aslan, and then help him in his slow march to the stone table.  The emotion in the story and the significance of the parallel at this point in the story is magnificent.  Without rambling on and on, this book is everything a classic should be.  A must read for all fans of fantasy, and who consider themselves religious.</span>

You feel as if nothing is ever going to happen again.”</span>

<span class="readable">“I wrote this story for you, but when I began it I had not realized that girls grow quicker than books. As a result you are already too old for fairy tales, and by the time it is printed and bound you will be older still. But some day you will be old enough to start reading fairy tales again. You can then take it down from some upper shelf, dust it, and tell me what you think of it. I shall probably be too deaf to hear, and too old to understand a word you say, but I shall still be your affectionate Godfather, C. S. Lewis.”</span>
