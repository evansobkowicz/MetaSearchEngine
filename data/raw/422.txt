As the events of <i>The Lion King 1½</i> occur during the same time as the original film, his upbringing with Timon &amp; Pumbaa is further explored. Jonathan Taylor Thomas played young Simba and Matthew Broderick played adult Simba. During the 1993 production of the first <i>Lion King</i> film, his name was originally "Kimba" and he was going to be <a href="/wiki/Leucism" title="Leucism">leucistic</a>, however, this was quickly changed to avoid copyright issues with a 1966 anime known in America as <a href="/wiki/Kimba_the_White_Lion" title="Kimba the White Lion"><i>Kimba The White Lion</i></a>.</p>

<p><b>Nala</b> is a character in <i>The Lion King</i>. She is Simba's closest playmate in childhood and later his wife. She first debuts as a cub in the first film of the franchise who accompanies Simba in his venture into the forbidden Elephant Graveyard. Nala is depicted as being as mischievous, adventurous, and playful, as Simba. She later appears mourning over Simba's alleged "death" before finally reappearing as a lovely young adult who unknowingly entangles herself in a brawl with a matured Simba after having attempted to attack Pumbaa. To the chagrin of Timon and Pumbaa, a romance gradually blossoms between the pair during the sequence "Can You Feel the Love Tonight?", though their relationship is interfered after Nala urges her reluctant friend to return to the dilapidated Pride Lands, corrupted by Scar's tyrannical kingship, and claim the throne. After Simba is encouraged by Rafiki and his father's spirit to return home and confront his uncle, an overjoyed Nala, accompanied by Timon, Pumbaa, and the lionesses of the Pride Lands, compete in the malicious battle allied with him against the hyenas after successfully toppling Scar's reign. She was horrified when Simba admitted to her and the other lionesses his mistaken belief that he was responsible for Mufasa's death, and enraged when she later learned that it was in fact Scar who had murdered Mufasa and had tricked Simba into thinking he was responsible for his father's death. Defying the vow they had proclaimed as cubs repulsed at the prospect of being betrothed, she marries Simba and together the two have a daughter named Kiara.</p>
<p>In the following sequel, <i>The Lion King ll: Simba's Pride,</i> the significance of Nala's role is downgraded, though she still makes frequent appearances throughout the course of the film, where she is depicted as slightly older than she was in the first film, being looser, calmer, and less uptight than her overprotective husband, but reappears when necessary. Naturally, she also appears with a similarly-reduced role in <i>The Lion King 1½</i>, a direct-to-video followup retelling the events of the first film from Timon and Pumbaa's viewpoints, in which the pair's attempts at thwarting her developing romance with Simba and her explanation of Simba's background to them are further detailed.</p>
<p>Nala is set to appear in the upcoming <a href="/wiki/Disney_Junior" title="Disney Junior">Disney Junior</a> series <i><a href="/wiki/The_Lion_Guard_(TV_series)" title="The Lion Guard (TV series)">The Lion Guard</a></i> where she and Simba will have another child together, a son named Kion.</p>

<p><b>Mufasa</b> was Simba's father, Sarabi's husband, Scar's older brother and the former King of the Pride Lands. He is characterized as a righteous, wise and kindhearted leader, but admirably powerful and courageous as well. Idolized by his son, with whom he shared a strong bond, Mufasa was envied immensely during his lifetime by Scar, who furiously conspired against his older brother in an attempt to end his reign and seize the throne. After saving Simba, during a massive stampede of <a href="/wiki/Wildebeest" title="Wildebeest">wildebeests</a> caused by the hyenas under Scar's order, Scar causes Mufasa to fall from a cliff to be trampled to death. Scar gains a tyrannical kingship over Pride Rock after exiling Simba from home, having convinced him that he was responsible for Mufasa's untimely death. Although Simba spends a majority of the film suffering from intense guilt, Mufasa reappears as a ghostly apparition in the clouds commanding Simba to return home. This later empowers him to confront his uncle. His voice is heard again following the death of his evil brother and his death avenged, telling Simba to "Remember who you are".</p>
<p>After Mufasa died, he barely reappears in two direct-to-video sequels spawned from <i>The Lion King,</i> albeit his spirit appears in the opening sequence of <i>The Lion King II: Simba's Pride</i> proudly watching over the presentation of his newborn granddaughter Princess Kiara, and it also is established that the lingering effects of the memory of Mufasa's murder have apparently scarred a traumatized Simba for life. This is revealed during a dream sequence in which Simba relives the events of the stampede as an adult and attempts to save his father's life but was stopped by Scar who turned into Kovu. After Simba banishes Kovu for supposedly causing an ambush, Kiara angerly tells her father that he will never be Mufasa, suggesting that Mufasa would have forgiven Kovu and would have seen that the ambush set by Kovu's mother Zira wasn't his fault. At the conclusion of the same movie, his voiceover can also be heard congratulating his son for his well-executed reign. During the followup <i>The Lion King 1½</i>, Mufasa's role is reduced even further as the plot of first film of the franchise is retold from the viewpoints of Timon and Pumbaa. His apparition to Simba is relived through the two characters' eyes.</p>
<p>According to <i>The Lion King: Six New Adventures</i> story "A Tale of Two Brothers", his parents were called Ahadi and Uru.</p>

<p><b>Sarabi</b> is Simba's mother, Mufasa's wife, Scar's sister-in-law and Kiara, Kion and Kopa's paternal grandmother. Her name means "mirage" in Swahili. Not much of her relationship with Simba and Mufasa is shown (as when Simba is a cub, the film revolves mainly around his relationships with Mufasa and Nala) but from what is shown she seems to be very attached to them both. She is devastated when she believes they both have been killed (in reality only Mufasa had been killed while Simba is alive) and is seen being comforted by Zazu while Scar is giving them a eulogy. She was horrified when Scar, having taken over the throne, then let the hyenas take over the Pride Lands and, along with all the other lionesses and animals from Pride Rock, apparently suffered as a result of Scar's selfish ways while he was king. Many years after Mufasa's death, Sarabi, who by now clearly dislikes Scar strongly, argued with him over what should be done for the good of all the animals in Pride Rock, with her insisting that they needed to move to a different place where food and water would be available. He refuses, afraid of losing his kingship in any place that isn't Pride Rock, and angrily strikes his sister-in-law for telling him he isn't "half the king Mufasa was." At which point Simba, who had watched this from afar, revealed himself to them and defended his mother by roaring at Scar. She mistakes Simba for Mufasa at first, but is overjoyed all the same when she realizes her son is alive. She was horrified when Simba admitted he believed he was responsible for Mufasa's death and enraged when she later learned that it was in fact Scar who had murdered Mufasa and tricked Simba into believing he was the one responsible and was a big liar. She fights Scar's hyena army alongside Simba, Nala, the other lionesses, Timon, and Pumbaa and along with all the lionesses roars triumphantly when Simba does after finally defeating Scar who was been killed by the hyenas for his betrayal. According to one of the writers at Disney, Sarabi was originally planned to make an appearance in <i>The Lion King II: Simba's Pride</i>, but was cut from the film when her voice actress died.</p>

<p><b>Zazu</b> is a <a href="/wiki/Red-billed_hornbill" title="Red-billed hornbill">red-billed hornbill</a><sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-hornbill_4-0"><a href="#cite_note-hornbill-4"><span>[</span>4<span>]</span></a></sup> who acts as <a href="/wiki/Majordomo" title="Majordomo">majordomo</a> to Mufasa and later Simba. He is proud of his position and acts very dignified, though he is not taken very seriously by the lions. Zazu's name has no apparent meaning in Swahili.</p>
<p>Zazu is first seen in the film flying over the Pride Lands during the opening sequence, in which Simba is presented. After Simba's birth ceremony, he goes to announce Mufasa's arrival to Scar and treats the lion with contempt and nearly gets eaten. Although he is clearly Mufasa's close friend and jokes with him, he treats the king with great respect, addressing him as <a href="/wiki/Sire" title="Sire">Sire</a> (though on one occasion he calls him by his name). When Simba is a little older, Zazu becomes the target of a pouncing lesson in the middle of delivering a news report to the king, which dismays him. Sarabi later orders the hornbill to chaperone Simba and Nala to the waterhole. In the song "<a href="/wiki/I_Just_Can%27t_Wait_to_Be_King" title="I Just Can't Wait to Be King">I Just Can't Wait to Be King</a>", Zazu sings about his doubts that someone as carefree as Simba would make a good king, but he isn't taken seriously and ends up, amusingly, being squashed by a rhino. Zazu catches up with them in the elephant graveyard and tries to protect them when they are confronted by hyenas, but Banzai pushes him into a geyser which rockets him into the sky. Zazu then apparently flies to get Mufasa to rescue the cubs. Zazu is with Mufasa when Scar brings the news of Simba being trapped in the wildebeest stampede; he panics and intends to go for help, but Scar slaps him into a wall and knocks him out.</p>
<p>After Simba's exile, Zazu becomes a prisoner of Scar and a source of entertainment. He is the only character who is seen to fear Scar and acknowledge his kingship, but Scar nonetheless tells the hyenas that they are welcome to eat him. During the battle for Pride Rock, Pumbaa breaks Zazu out of his ribcage prison. Zazu bows to Simba after he defeats Scar and is seen during the presentation of Simba and Nala's newborn cub.</p>
<p>Zazu has brief appearances in the two sequels. In <i>The Lion King II: Simba's Pride</i>, he acts as a scout and advises Simba on royal protocol. He is very scornful of Kovu. In <i>1½</i>, he is first seen at the presentation of Simba, talking to Mufasa. Then, he is seen racing with Mufasa to save Simba and Nala from the hyenas in the Elephant Graveyard.</p>
<p>In the musical, Zazu is a puppet controlled by an actor dressed in blue striped clothes and a <a href="/wiki/Bowler_hat" title="Bowler hat">bowler hat</a>, much like a stereotypical <a href="/wiki/Butler" title="Butler">butler</a>. Zazu's blue feathers have been replaced with white and the puppet is partially constructed from parachute silk with a slinky contained in the neck for ease in movement.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-puppets_5-0"><a href="#cite_note-puppets-5"><span>[</span>5<span>]</span></a></sup> Zazu sings the song "The Morning Report", which was fully animated for the Platinum Edition release of the original film. After "They Live In You", Mufasa and Zazu talk about Simba's behavior and Zazu remarks that Mufasa got into trouble too at Simba's age. In some English productions of the show, Zazu breaks the <a href="/wiki/Fourth_wall" title="Fourth wall">fourth wall</a> and uses <a href="/wiki/Anachronism" title="Anachronism">anachronisms</a> for comic effect.</p>

<p><b>Rafiki</b>, whose name means “friend” in Swahili, resembles most closely a <a href="/wiki/Mandrill" title="Mandrill">mandrill</a> with an unnaturally long tail, though as mandrills live in the forests of West Africa, it is more likely that he is a <a href="/wiki/Baboon" title="Baboon">baboon</a> with the facial coloring of a mandrill. He lives in a <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Baobab" title="Baobab">baobab</a> tree somewhere in the Pride Lands. He is a dear friend to Mufasa and Simba. He performs <a href="/wiki/Shamanism" title="Shamanism">shamanistic</a> services for the lions of Pride Rock. He is an enigmatic character, tending to speak about himself in the third person, who drops in unexpectedly to lend advice. Although very wise, he also has a very funny, playful side. As a bipedal animal, Rafiki is able to use props more easily than most of the films' animals. He is never seen without his stick, which is topped with <a href="/wiki/Gourd" title="Gourd">gourds</a> that he uses for ritual purposes, painting and food. The character often serves as the narrator of the story of <i>The Lion King</i>, especially in video games and merchandise.</p>
<p>In <i>The Lion King</i>, Rafiki is introduced in the opening scene when he travels to Pride Rock to perform newborn Simba's presentation ceremony. Mufasa greets him like a friend he has not seen in a long time. Rafiki anoints Simba and presents him to the gathered animals, and later draws a stylized lion cub on the walls of his treehouse home to represent Simba's birth. When Simba is believed to be dead, Rafiki draws his hand across the Simba painting, obscuring it in grief. Years later, after picking up his scent on the dust in the air, Rafiki realizes that Simba is still alive and joyously restores the drawing, adding the full mane of an adult lion. He travels to the jungle where Simba lives with Timon and Pumbaa, then observes Simba and recognizes that he is suffering from a ponderous emotional burden. To treat it, he approaches the young lion (who does not recognise him) and teaches him a few playful, and sometimes painful, lessons about learning from the past, not running from it. He shows Simba that his father Mufasa lives in him, resulting in the appearance of Mufasa's ghost which gives Simba the courage to face his past. During the battle for Pride Rock, Rafiki displays highly trained martial arts against the hyenas and saves Simba from a hyena who tried to attack him by bashing the hyena in the head hard with his stick. Simba embraces him before ascending Pride Rock as king telling him "It is time", and at the end of the film, Rafiki presents Simba and Nala's newborn cub.</p>
<p>During the film, Rafiki sings a nonsense chant: "Asante sana, squash banana, wewe nugu, mimi hapana." This is a Swahili playground rhyme which translates to "Thank you very much (squash banana), you're a baboon and I'm not!" Like "hakuna matata" (no worries), the chant was heard by the filmmakers on their research trip to Kenya.</p>
<p>In the sequel <i>The Lion King II: Simba's Pride</i>, Rafiki is more closely involved with the affairs and politics of the prides and is often seen with the lions. Mufasa's spirit persuades him to bring Simba's daughter Kiara and Zira's son Kovu together as a way of uniting the prides. He then asks if Mufasa is crazy and doubts that the plan will work, and is then immediately buffeted by a strong gust of wind from Mufasa's spirit. Rafiki tries to make them fall in love by singing to them about a place called "Upendi", which means "love" in Swahili. When Simba exiles Kovu, blaming him for the attack set up by Zira, Rafiki sighs sadly on seeing Kovu leave, knowing he is not part of the attack and Simba is defying his father's goals. In the end, he blesses the union of Kovu and Kiara and Kovu is welcomed into the pride. Rafiki appears briefly in <i>The Lion King 1½</i>, teaching Timon the philosophy of "<a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Hakuna_Matata" title="Hakuna Matata">Hakuna Matata</a>" and later convincing Timon to follow Simba to Pride Rock to confront Scar.</p>
<p>In the musical, the character of Rafiki was significantly modified. Because director <a href="/wiki/Julie_Taymor" title="Julie Taymor">Julie Taymor</a> felt that the story lacked a strong female character, Rafiki was changed into a female mandrill and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Sangoma" title="Sangoma">sangoma</a>. She acts as an involved narrator throughout the story, at one point speaking to the audience in a <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Click_language#Languages_with_clicks" title="Click language">click language</a> for comic effect. She sings the opening song "<a href="/wiki/Circle_of_Life" title="Circle of Life">Circle of Life</a>", a <a href="/wiki/Keening" title="Keening">keening</a> song called "Rafiki Mourns" following Mufasa's death, and a brief part in Nala's song "Shadowland", when she blesses Nala for her journey to find help. Instead of detecting Simba's scent on dust, Rafiki hears Simba's song "Endless Night" on the wind. Rafiki finds Simba and shows him that his father lives on in him through the song "<a href="/wiki/He_Lives_in_You" title="He Lives in You">He Lives in You</a>". She is present during the battle, fighting a hyena using hand-to-hand combat, and adorns Simba with the king's mantle after his victory. And the play ends with her presentation of Simba and Nala's cub.</p>
<p>Rafiki appears in a few episodes of the <i>Timon and Pumbaa</i> TV series and has his own series of skits called "Rafiki Fables" in the same show. He appears briefly in the Pride Lands world of <i>Kingdom Hearts II</i>.</p>

<p><b>Shenzi, Banzai and Ed</b> are a <a href="/wiki/Spotted_hyena" title="Spotted hyena">spotted hyena</a> trio who are Scar's followers.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Shenzi</b> (voiced by <a href="/wiki/Whoopi_Goldberg" title="Whoopi Goldberg">Whoopi Goldberg</a>) is the only female of the trio. Her name means 'savage', 'uncouth', or 'poor quality' in Swahili. She is confident, self-controlled, and the smartest of the three, only very rarely losing her temper. This makes her the de facto leader of the trio and possibly the entire clan, which is realistic, because female dominance is the social norm of spotted hyenas in real life. She does not hesitate to follow Scar's orders to attack, nor to confront him later about the lack of food. Shenzi has a longer mane than Banzai and Ed and also has three prominent bangs hanging over her face. She additionally lacks the dark grey 'stubble' snout of her two partners. Shenzi was originally going to be a male and voiced by <a href="/wiki/Tommy_Chong" title="Tommy Chong">Tommy Chong</a> to reunite him with his old comedy partner <a href="/wiki/Cheech_Marin" title="Cheech Marin">Cheech Marin</a>, who was playing Banzai, but apparently the two had had a falling out, so Shenzi was reconceived as a female and Whoopi Goldberg was hired for the role.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-6"><a href="#cite_note-6"><span>[</span>6<span>]</span></a></sup></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Banzai</b> (voiced by <a href="/wiki/Cheech_Marin" title="Cheech Marin">Cheech Marin</a>) is the most aggressive and excitable of the trio. He speaks in a raised voice and is shown to have little patience, which makes him quick to get into fights, but he tends to submit to Shenzi. He is also rather greedy, often making references to being hungry and asking for food. Banzai tends to come out badly in conflict situations: he gets the worst injuries when the trio are attacked by Mufasa (Shenzi and Ed receive only minor scratches, but Banzai moans that he "won't be able to sit for a week"), is knocked into thorn bushes when chasing Simba, and nearly gets into trouble with Scar when he complains that Scar's leadership is worse than Mufasa's. His name means 'skulk' or 'lurk' in Swahili, but it is also a battle cry in Japanese (<a href="/wiki/Banzai_charge" title="Banzai charge">Banzai charge</a>). His appearance generally resembles the unnamed hyena characters.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Ed</b> (voiced by <a href="/wiki/Jim_Cummings" title="Jim Cummings">Jim Cummings</a>) is one of the few characters not to have a Swahili name. He communicates almost entirely through crazed laughter. His eyes never seem to focus on anything properly, and he wears a permanent idiotic grin with his tongue usually lolling out. Despite his short attention span and comical personality, Ed is actually not ignorant or stupid; he 'knows the score', but just does not speak (though whether out of inability or apathy is unclear). While Shenzi and Banzai are joking with each other about eating Simba and Nala, it is Ed who notices that they have escaped. Jim Cummings recorded over four hours of different laughter clips for use with Ed's dialogue.</li>
</ul>
<p>The three hyenas first appear in the elephant graveyard where they taunt and chase Simba, Nala and Zazu, intending to eat them, but are attacked by Mufasa. Scar reinforces their loyalty with food and promises the whole hyena clan that they will never go hungry if they help him become king. This they do, helping Scar carry out his plan to kill Mufasa by triggering the wildebeest stampede. Scar orders the hyenas to kill Simba, but Simba eludes them by crawling through a thorn-patch. Shenzi decides to tell Scar he is dead, reckoning that Scar will never know better. During Scar's reign, the trio complain about lack of food, but Scar is indifferent. The clan fights on Scar's side when Simba returns, but most are defeated by the lionesses, and Shenzi and Banzai are ruthlessly beaten up by Pumbaa for Banzai calling him a pig as Ed waits outside. The trio then overhear Scar trying to blame them for Mufasa's death and the ruin of the Pride Lands, which infuriates them. Fueled with anger at Scar for his betrayal (as well as, presumably, hunger, from his broken promise of them never going hungry again), the hyenas leap upon Scar and maul him alive.</p>
<p>The hyenas are briefly mentioned in <i><a href="/wiki/The_Lion_King_II:_Simba%27s_Pride" title="The Lion King II: Simba's Pride">The Lion King II: Simba's Pride</a></i> by Nuka, who says that they 'ran off' from the elephant graveyard. They were planned to be Zira's minions, but this idea was ditched because the hyenas devoured Scar for his treachery and blaming them for killing his own brother and therefore could not be loyal to Scar in the sequel. Zira should know that it was the hyenas who really did kill Scar due to blaming them for murdering his own brother. In their first appearance, they attack a meerkat colony while Timon is daydreaming on sentry duty. The trio reappear during the film's climax at Pride Rock, cornering Timon and Pumbaa. Timon proposes marriage to Shenzi as a delaying tactic, which she turns down abruptly. The hyenas then fall into a meerkat tunnel, which transports them to Scar in time to confront him.</p>
<p>The three hyenas make occasional appearances in the <i>Timon &amp; Pumbaa</i> TV series with their own segment "The Laughing Hyenas". In <i>Kingdom Hearts II</i>, the hyenas appear in the Pride Lands world as Scar's followers. They also appear as villains in <a href="/wiki/Mickey%27s_Not-So-Scary_Halloween_Party" title="Mickey's Not-So-Scary Halloween Party">Mickey's Not-So-Scary Halloween Party</a> at <a href="/wiki/Walt_Disney_World" title="Walt Disney World">Walt Disney World</a>.</p>

<p><b>Sarafina</b> is Nala's mother, Simba's mother-in-law and Kiara, Kion and Kopa's maternal grandmother. She is a pale-furred lioness with a slender build, much like her daughter as an adult. Her name has no meaning in Swahili and is not mentioned in the film, only appearing in the credits. Her uncredited dedicated animator is Silvia Hoefnagels. Sarafina plays a minor role, appearing a few times throughout the film. She only has one line of dialogue: "Hmmm, what do you think, Sarabi?" Her first appearance is in Nala's introduction, when she is bathing her cub; she is also seen as the lionesses mourn Mufasa and Simba, and later when they fight the hyenas when Scar reveals that he was Mufasa's killer and framed Simba who is still alive. According to the song "Chow Down" from the musical, Sarafina ate Banzai's father.</p>

<p><b>Quint</b> is a sneaky, muscular guy with black hair, a pink nose, and a shaven face with varying roles. His wears different clothes in each episode because of the different jobs he has, but he is often seen wearing a hat. He also has different first names that show what his jobs are (they all seem to start with C).</p>
<p>Quint is a con artist who tricks Timon into stealing a gold nugget Pumbaa found in the episode "Yukon Con", a criminal who stole a suitcase that has $1,290,000 in the episode "How to Beat the High Costa Rica", an evil clock inspector who wants to get revenge on a timekeeper in the episode "Swiss Missed", a French chef who wants to make Speedy the Snail an escargot in the episode "French Fried", etc.. In the episode "The Pain in Spain", two Quints were seen together, which can reveal that there is more than one of him.</p>
<p>In some episodes, Quint appears to be a non-villainous man with an honest job, but he still seems to annoy Timon and Pumbaa. Notably in Season 2, Quint's face appears to not be shaven, except in the episode "Klondike Con" when he becomes a gold thief. Also, in the episode "Escape From Newark", his nose is the same color as his body for the first time.</p>

<p><b>Speedy</b> is a kind-hearted talking and singing bluish-grayish snail with a shiny red shell and a yellow fedora. In the episode "French Fried", Timon and Pumbaa were about to eat him until they found out he can talk and sing. Timon gave him the name "Speedy" because he thought it would be a brilliant incongruity for a snail. Speedy always finds himself in danger, such as becoming a French gourmet snail and an earring out of his shell, and it's always up for Timon and Pumbaa to save him.</p>
<p>In the episode "The Man from J.U.N.G.L.E.", it is shown that Speedy is a superhero called Super Duper Hero X after Timon and Pumbaa were captured by his nemesis Chromosome Quint. Every episode featuring Speedy end with Timon and Pumbaa saying bye to Speedy, a seagull capturing Speedy, and then Timon and Pumbaa trying to save him once again.</p>

<p>When Fred visits Timon and Pumbaa, he pulls more practical jokes on the duo, such as impersonating Timon's mother or impersonating a Billy Goat guard. Timon and Pumbaa, however, don't find Fred's jokes very funny and they often overpower him. At the meerkat colony, Fred's job was to guard the Duke Meerkat's castle, but when Timon got banished, his new job was to guard the back gate of the colony. He appears in a total of four episodes: "Tanzania Zany", "Mombasa-In-Law", "Once Upon a Timon", and "Mind Over Matterhorn".</p>

<p><b>Cheetata and Cheetato</b> are a pair of sophisticated twin cheetahs. In order to tell them apart, not only do they have different voices, but they also have different personalities: Cheetato appears to be more eager and aggressive while Cheetata seems more likely to think things through.</p>
<p>They first appear in the episode "Cooked Goose," where they try to get rid of Shenzi, Banzai, and Ed by sending them on various wild goose chases so that they can catch and eat a wildebeest. The hyenas later find out that they've been tricked and they go to the cheetahs to eat them. They then get interrupted by a wild goose, who asks them for directions to a Wild Goose Convention. After showing him the way, the cheetahs and the hyenas chase him.</p>
<p>In the episode "Gabon with the Wind," the cheetahs catch Timon and are about to eat him. Timon convinces the cheetahs to let him go catch Pumbaa for them, so they let him go, but take his wallet after overhearing him saying what he was up to. After Timon tells Pumbaa about him tricking the cheetahs, Cheetata and Cheetato find the duo and are about to eat them. When Cheetata calls Pumbaa a pig, the warthog goes berserk and knocks the cheetahs into a tree.</p>
<p>In the episode "Boary Glory Days," Timon and Pumbaa use Cheetata and Cheetato to play a game of Predator Tag. When the cheetahs chase the two, Timon and Pumbaa trick them by making them jump over a mud pool, which they fall into.</p>

<p><b>The Three Natives</b> are a trio of indigenous peoples. They are actually university students. They have a leader (also voiced by Jeff Bennett) who is also a university student and who usually precedes what he says with "Bungala, bun gala."</p>
<p>The natives first appear in "Boara Boara," where they kidnap Pumbaa so they could eat him, but they later mistake him for their god-king. When Timon is about to leave with Pumbaa, the natives stop them and are about to throw Timon into a volcano. Timon says he'll do anything and they make him be Pumbaa's servant. Things go well until Pumbaa has to relight a fire. That is when the natives realize that Pumbaa is an imposter and they try to go catch the two, who manage to escape by making them dance.</p>
<p>In the episode "New Guinea Pig," when Pumbaa gets tired of his tusks, he and Timon decide to sell them to the Three Natives. But when Pumbaa is unable to remove his tusks, the natives take out their weapons to kill Pumbaa and cut the tusks off. Timon and Pumbaa run away from them and they chase the two. In the episode "Beast of Eden," the natives have a gold tooth that belongs to a beast and Timon and Pumbaa try numerous ways to retrieve it. Their final attempt succeeds and the natives get chased by the beast</p>
<p>The natives also make a brief appearance in the episode "Mozam-Beaked," when Timon and Pumbaa are about to throw a woodpecker into the volcano.</p>

<p><b>Smolder</b>, or <b>Mr. Bear</b>, is a grumpy, short-tempered, but genuinely a nice grizzly bear. He is not exactly one of Timon and Pumbaa's enemies, but he gets angry at them very easily, such as the duo waking him up from his nap or the duo getting his food order wrong. He is also shown to have romantic interests on a beautiful supermodel named Leslie Lambeau (voiced by <a href="/wiki/Grey_DeLisle" title="Grey DeLisle">Grey DeLisle</a>).</p>
<p>In the episode "Jailhouse Shock," Smolder becomes cell mates with Little Jimmy. Little Jimmy takes advantage of him by getting him to hurt Timon and Pumbaa for doing mean things to him.

<p><b>Tatiana</b> is the daughter of the Duke Meerkat and the princess of the meerkat colony. She only appears in one episode, but she's vital for Timon's past. One day when the Duke leaves the colony, Fred tells Timon that it's his chance to go on a date with Tatiana. So Timon goes into the colony and then a cobra shows up and sees that the back gate is unprotected. So it invades the meerkat colony and kidnaps Tatiana, making everyone believe she's dead. When the Duke returns, he finds out that Tatiana is missing and he banishes Timon for abandoning his guard post. After Timon meets Pumbaa, the duo see that Tatiana is still alive and they rescue her and bring her back to the colony. Tatiana then offers Timon a hand in marriage but when the Duke makes him choose between Tatiana or Pumbaa, he chooses to be Bestest Best friends with Pumbaa instead.</p>
<p>Although "Once Upon a Timon" is meant to be Tatiana's only appearance, there is a female meerkat who bears a striking resemblance to her in the episode "Timon in Love." Only difference is that Tatiana is a blonde while the other meerkat has red hair.</p>

<p><b>Ned</b> is a high and mighty elephant who thinks he's wonderful at everything. He can also be selfish and sarcastic and he enjoys teasing Timon and Pumbaa whenever they try to prove their worth to him.</p>
<p>In the episode "Uganda be an Elephant," Timon shows Ned that he transformed Pumbaa into an elephant, but Ned says that it's "the most ridiculous thing he's ever seen in his entire life" and he and his hippo friends laugh at the warthog and fall off a cliff. After Pumbaa saves their lives, Ned has a change of heart and suggests that Pumbaa should join their group as an honorary elephant, but Pumbaa decides to stay as a warthog.</p>
<p>Ned has a good luck club in "Unlucky in Lesotho." The number of members of the club declined when Ned brought an unlucky jar. Timon decides to join Ned's Good Luck Club and the elephant makes him protect a lucky jar for one day. But when a panther kitten breaks the jar, Timon tries to fool Ned by sticking the pieces back together. Ned, however, is not convinced and he laughs and makes fun of Timon and is about to tell the whole jungle about him. He runs into the panther kitten and falls into a ravine. Because he gets eaten by piranhas, Ned is never seen again after this episode.</p>

<p><b>Kiara</b> is the daughter of Simba and Nala, granddaughter of Mufasa, Sarabi and Sarafina and the main protagonist of <i>The Lion King ll: Simba's Pride.</i> She is portrayed as the feisty, playful, and adventurous princess of Pride Rock, but her over-protective father, Simba, easily fears for her safety and employs the assistance of <a href="/wiki/Timon_and_Pumbaa" title="Timon and Pumbaa">Timon and Pumbaa</a> in watching over her during her explorations in secret. However, Kiara is discontented, not realizing her father's lack of faith in her, wanders off while her babysitters are distracted and winds up stumbling upon an Outsider cub named Kovu. Kovu initially appears to be untrustworthy and teases Kiara, but when they are faced by a group of <a href="/wiki/Nile_crocodile" title="Nile crocodile">crocodiles</a> Kiara manages to help lead Kovu to safety, resulting in a friendship between the pair. However, they are separated by their parents for the rivalry between their two groups, much to the cubs' dismay.</p>
<p>Years later, during Kiara's first hunt, Kovu's mother Zira sees an opportunity to fulfill her dreams of obtaining revenge on Simba for exiling the Outsiders and sends her other children Nuka and Vitani to spread a wildfire throughout the Pride Lands. As part of Zira's plan, Kovu runs into the fire and rescues Kiara. Simba rewards Kovu for his actions by permitting him to stay with the Pridelanders, and Kovu gradually begins to fall in love with his childhood friend. However, after Zira and her Outsiders attack and injure Simba severely, Kovu is exiled from the Pride Lands. Kiara ignores her father's warnings not to leave the Pride Lands without an escort and finds Kovu. She reveals that if they do not return then their prides will be divided forever, so they set off. As the pair arrive back home they see their prides engaged in a fierce battle. Kiara and Kovu leap in and end the battle by confronting their parents, but Zira, still enraged, leaps at Simba only for Kiara to block her and send them both tumbling into a flooded gorge. Kiara is rescued, but Zira refuses Kiara's help and dies. Simba realizes that the pride is better united and, now joined, the two prides head back to Pride Rock. Kovu and Kiara are united in marriage as the rest of the pride looks on.</p>
<p>She will appear in the upcoming spin-off series <i>The Lion Guard</i>, which centers around her younger brother Kion.</p>

<p><b>Kovu</b> is Zira's youngest son, Scar's adoptive son and chosen heir. Kovu means "scar" in Swahili, a reference to his character conception as Scar's son, which was changed due to the implications of him and Kiara being second cousins and falling in love. It is never stated who Kovu's father is, only that Scar 'took him in'. Kovu has very dark fur and a black tuft on top of his head as a cub, which develops into a mane with a similar tuft.</p>
<p>As a cub, Kovu lives a rough life in the barren Outlands in Zira's pride of exiles loyal to Scar. After his older brother Nuka leaves him alone, Kovu meets Kiara and brags about his independence, impressing her. The cubs evade some crocodiles and begin to play, but are interrupted and separated by their parents. Zira confronts Kovu for being friendly towards Kiara. When he says he thought they could be friends, Zira hatches a plan to have Kovu infiltrate Simba's pride. Zira trains and conditions Kovu until he is grown, instilling a single-minded dedication to his mission to assassinate Simba and take his place as King of Pride Rock.</p>
<p>Kovu's siblings Vitani and Nuka stage a situation for Kovu to 'rescue' Kiara. He tells Simba that he is a rogue who has left the Outsiders, and asks to join the pride. Simba then reluctantly allows him to stay in payment of the debt of Kiara's life, and orders the young lion to sleep outside the den, not bothering to hide his contempt. Kovu is scornful of Kiara's inability to hunt, but helps her learn; in turn, she starts to teach him to have fun, and Kovu begins to doubt his mission. He tries to tell Kiara the truth, fearing that he will become like Scar, but feels unable and starts to leave. Rafiki intervenes and tries to get the two lions to fall in love, and Kovu realizes he cannot hurt Simba. A much changed Kovu resolves to confess his abandoned motives and tell Kiara of his love, but before he can do so, Simba, who has instantly warmed up to Kovu, takes him on a walk to talk to him about Scar, and Zira's Outsiders ambush them. Kovu tries to help Simba, but Vitani prevents him from doing so. Simba escapes but Nuka dies, and Zira blames Kovu. She strikes him, giving him a scar over his eye, similar to that of Scar's. Kovu angrily disowns Scar and leaves the Outlands. He attempts to ask for Simba's forgiveness, only to be exiled as a traitor.</p>
<p>Kovu wanders alone trying to escape Scar's influence in his life. Kiara finds him and he wants to start a new pride with her, but she convinces him that they must try to reunite their own divided prides. The lions return to Pride Rock and break up a battle, and Kovu ignores his mother's warnings, deciding to protect Kiara and Simba. Kovu quietly mourns his mother's death after she falls despite their estrangement. Simba admits that he was wrong about Kovu and allows him to join the pride as Kiara's husband and grooming him to become his successor.</p>

<p><b>Zira</b>, meaning "hate" in Swahili, was the mother of Kovu, Nuka and Vitani and is the main antagonist of <i>The Lion King II: Simba's Pride</i>. She was a faithful follower of Scar who is devastated over his demise and craves vengeance on Simba for exiling her and her fellow Outsiders. A powerful contributing factor to her rage with Simba is that her son Kovu was selected by Scar as his <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Heir" title="Heir">heir</a>; therefore, Zira believes that Kovu is entitled to the throne more than Simba and plots his demise. However, she takes advantage of Kovu's friendship with Simba's daughter Kiara and devises a plan in which the friendship can prove helpful to her in doing away with the king of Pride Rock. She later appears while carrying out the final stages of this plan, but fails and her neglected eldest son Nuka is crushed to death by falling logs during the Outsiders' attempt at murdering Simba. She blames Kovu for the incident and scratches him in the face giving him a scar like Scar's.</p>
<p>Toward the end of the film, the Pride Landers and the Outsiders confront one another yet again for a bloodthirsty, malicious battle between both sides, but Kiara's actions as a mediator manage to turn the exiled Outsiders against their former brutal ways and join the more peaceful lifestyle of the Pridelanders. Abandoned and enraged, Zira tries to attack Simba, but is intercepted by Kiara. Zira fights Kiara until she is hanging on a cliff; she refuses Kiara's help and falls into the rapid river apparently killing her (in a scene where she was originally intended to commit suicide willingly by falling into the same canyon, but this was edited as it was viewed as too brutal). Despite Zira's death, her original dream for Kovu to become king is most likely to come true, since Kovu makes no intentions of killing Simba and instead help him while entering a relationship with Kiara in addition his actions proving both prides of his character and worth, and because of that, Simba will allow Kovu to become his successor.</p>

<p><b>Nuka</b>, meaning "stink" in Swahili, was the secondary antagonist of <i>The Lion King II: Simba's Pride</i> who is Zira's son and the elder brother of Kovu and Vitani. Nuka has greyish-brown fur, a straggly black mane, and a goatee like Scar's. He has uniquely goofy features and bent whiskers, and is infested with termites as an adolescent. Nuka is an envious youth who tries much too hard and is not taken seriously. He is bitter about being passed over for succession to the throne in favour of the younger Kovu, and deeply jealous of Zira's greater affection shown towards his brother. He constantly seeks his mother's approval and has an apparent tendency for pyromania, taking manic pleasure from lighting a fire in the grassland. During Simba's ambush, Nuka tries to kill him to prove himself to his mother, but is lethally crushed by falling logs. Ironically when Zira attacks Simba, Nuka dies at the same site where Mufasa dies in the first movie. After his death, Zira mourns him and asks Scar to watch over him, then later blames Kovu for Nuka's demise.</p>

<p><b>Vitani</b>, a Swahili portmanteau of the words "Vita" ("War"), "Ni" ("I Am"), and "Shetani", is Zira's daughter, sister to Nuka and Kovu. In a minor role, she is easily recognizable due to her blue eyes, scruffy hair tuft, and freckles. She was originally named "Shetani" ("She-Demon" in Swahili) in early drafts of the <i>The Lion King II: Simba's Pride</i> script, but this was softened to "Vitani", which is a portmanteau that can be roughly translated to "I Am War" or, more commonly, "Demon of War". Vitani is introduced as an aggressive cub who is seen teasing Nuka and challenging Kovu to a playful fight. As a young adult lioness, she appears to be Zira's strongest lieutenant, supporting and acting on her mother's violent plans. During the battle, she confronts and fights with Nala, but she and the lions of the Outsiders were wrong, they joined Simba by his side. She is last seen standing by Kovu and Kiara, without further lines of dialogue and seems to disappear completely during and after Zira's death, her reaction to which is unknown. However, in a German-made comic adaptation of the film, she plays a slightly larger role, having more dialogue than in the film and is shown to have witnessed Zira's fall into the trench, just as shocked as Kovu and Nala.</p>

<p><b>Ma</b> appears in <i>The Lion King 1½</i> as Timon's mother. Her personal name is unknown. She is a chubby middle-aged meerkat with a light fur tuft on her head, like Timon's. Generally encouraging and optimistic, she believes in Timon when no-one else does and convinces Uncle Max to give him a job as a sentry, or look-out. After Timon fails in his duty, she remains convinced that he can still find a place in the colony, but when he insists that he has to go, Ma supports him. Later she gets worried about Timon after speaking to Rafiki and searches for him. They finally reunite at Pride Rock and Ma helps in the battle against the hyenas by digging a long tunnel to trap them. After Simba becomes king, the death of Scar and avenging Mufasa, Timon takes them and the entire meerkat colony to the jungle paradise he and Pumbaa discovered.</p>

<p><b>Uncle Max</b> is a prominent member of the meerkat colony and relative of Timon and Ma. He has grey head-fur and a very large nose. Max is a <a href="/wiki/Pessimism" title="Pessimism">pessimist</a> by nature and very paranoid, believing that a meerkat's fate is to be "food for other animals! Feared by nothing and eaten by all!" Max reluctantly agrees to let Timon be a sentry for the colony and attempts to train him for the job, but is nearly eaten by the hyenas when they attack. He is glad to see Timon go but ends up going with Ma to find him. Max appears again towards the end of the film, where he and Ma encounter Timon and Pumbaa at Pride Rock, and helps Timon get rid of the hyenas by digging a tunnel. Max finally believes in Timon, and after Timon takes the meerkats to his jungle paradise, Max teaches the meerkats <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/T%27ai_chi_ch%27uan" title="T'ai chi ch'uan">tai chi</a> instead of how not to be eaten.</p>
