I love sea stories, "man overboard!" and "off the port bow!" and "aye aye cap'n!" all that stuff so I pulled my hat down and started reading.  This book totally tricked me!  There weren't any torpedoes, no "anchors aweigh!", no old salts telling tales of sea serpents and sexy narwhals, no peg legs, no giant squid, nothing.  It had rabbits!  This book totally tricked me! <br><br>Crazy thing is, it was awesome!  Bigwig is the man!  The rabbit man.  Before I was even done I took down one of my Rick Springfield posters, flipped it over, and drew Bigwig protecting the rest of the warren (my favorite part).  It came out wrong, I can't draw, so I kind of have a fat dog standing in a hole hanging on my wall but I don't care and I still I give this book FIVE STARS!

<span id="freeText7947371091205582148" style="display:none">Ok, so it's a book about a bunch of rabbits traveling through a small stretch of English countryside. As such, it doesn't seem like something that would appeal to anyone but a preteen. But the fact of the matter is this is a great story, full of rich characters, a deep (if occasionally erroneous) understanding of things lapine, and it can reach moments of depth and profundity that the movie of the same title does not even begin to hint at. I was actually introduced to this book in one of the best ways I can imagine: a friend recorded the entire book on tape, and for a couple months I played the tapes of her reading a chapter or two just before I fell asleep each night. My slow exposure to the book under ideal circumstances may have influenced my perceptions, but I can say on each subsequent rereading of the book I've come to appreciate it more. You can read the book just for the story: apparently, the author wrote the book from stories he would tell his children, and it still can easily serve that purpose. But the richness of his characters lead to many interesting analogies to human life. For instance, from Hazel you can learn profound things about leadership. Throughout the book you feel that Hazel is the natural-born leader of his group of rabbits, but Richard Adams was very careful to develop this impression through character features rather than power-relations. The contrast is clearly intentional since the other leaders of the book achieve leadership status through very different means. Many people think the book takes a strong stance against a particular kind of authoritarian rule, but it is important to recognize the book gives this impression not through structured diatribe or through argument, but rather it evolves out of character considerations, and out of the story itself. This means that the result is far more complex than a simple argument. For instance, although General Woundwort may be seen as the main enemy that Hazel has to deal with, and the authoritarian rabbit is portrayed rather negatively at times, Adams quite intentionally adds some details that make him admirable to the other rabbits, even to the very end. A diatribe would not be so complex. Fiver is another great character. He adds an element of magic to the story, and it allows Adams to link the rabbits he describes to a mythical world that enters into the story quite frequently. One can almost see Fiver as a manifestation of imagination in this world. Big-wig is another likable character, and the story of this rabbits experience in Efrafa is one of the highlights of the story. Besides the characters, the descriptions of England are also quite acute. You can actually track the course of the rabbits on maps, since Adams was careful to describe real places and things. That attention to detail is often missed in reviews of this book. Finally, the thing that brings all these features together and makes the book more than a mere story, or an account of human characters, or a diatribe against fascism, is the fact that Adams is quite conscious of the fact that he is telling the story from the perspective of rabbits. The challenges they face are rabbit-sized, the ideas about the external world are rabbitlike, the philosophical insights seem rabbitized, and Adams brings many of our anthropomorphized ideas of rabbits together with the reality of rabbits in a surprisingly coherent fashion. I suppose the book can be seen as a cultural study of an imaginatively rich but realistic rabbit world. I realize as I write this review that many other readers may not feel the same way about the book as I do. It does have some shortcomings. For instance, female characters only make a few appearances in the book, although I think Adams does show some sensitivity in their depictions. But, even with the limitations, I would recommend the book to anyone who likes a good story and who is willing to think deeply about a children's story.</span>

On the surface this is an engaging tale about a group of outcast rabbits who leave their warren at the promptings of one of their fellows who is able to foresee a great catastrophe on the horizon. Their adventures are varied and engaging, both while they trek to the place they will eventually call home (the eponymous Watership Down), and as they attempt to search for does to help re-populate their new warren from the militaristic Efrafa.<br><br>Adams does a neat trick in dealing with his rabbit characters. They are not quite humans and the way they try to puzzle out the world around them in a very animal-like way makes them more than just people in bunny-suits, though at the same time they are human-like, and varied, enough to engage the reader. They have their own language (with words and concepts derived from their understanding of the world), and perhaps most engagingly, they tell stories and myths based on their beloved folk-hero El-ahrairah. These stories, peppered throughout the book as chapters, are some of the most enjoyable parts of the tale and add a depth and interest to the rabbits and their 'culture' that is very endearing.<br><br>The rabbits themselves fill certain archetypal roles (the leader, the warrior, the seer, the scientist, the villain) while at the same time retaining individual characters and even developing as the story progresses. This is definitely not a children's story of 'fluffy wabbits' even if only taken at surface level; and when looked at below the surface it is a satisfying and fulfilling tale well worthy of the title "classic".<br><br><strong>Re-read, September, 2012:</strong> Yup, this is still a fantastic read. Man, that ending always gets me *sniff*. I think what really makes this story sing are the layers. Everything builds on all that came before it, whether it's plot, character, or theme. We grow to love a group of characters that may at first have seemed rather silly and what had started out as a simple here-to-there quest turns into, for me at least, something much more. Oh and one other thing: Bigwig is the man, his last stand against Woundwort is an amazing moment, but there's a reason why Hazel was Chief Rabbit.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></span>

I figured, hey, it’s almost Easter, so what the heck, I might as well try it again.  So I picked Watership Down back up with the intent of giving it just a few more pages. Much to my surprise, I was hooked. <br><span>[image error]</span><br><br>Alright, so these bunnies are not your cutsie Japanese anime bunnies. These bunnies are like the Johny Depp of bunnies. Picture the Rabbit of Caerbannog from Monty Python: that would probably be closer to the mark than Thumper from Bambi.<br><span>[image error]</span><br><br>Joking and random pictures aside, I thought this was excellent. I was not expecting to like it and that is why I am so shocked that I did. There was a lot more depth to this book than I ever expected. <br><strong>
<em>“Many human beings say that they enjoy the winter, but what they really enjoy is feeling proof against it.”</em>
</strong><br><br>The characters were great, I loved every single one of them. Bigwig was my favorite. I don’t know how anyone could read this book and NOT fall in love with Bigwig aka Thlayli. <br><strong>
<em>“My Chief Rabbit has told me to stay and defend this run, and until he says otherwise, I shall stay here.”</em>
</strong><br><br> And, lastly, <strong>how is this a children’s book?</strong> I am still trying to figure that one out. Aside from the fact that the story is about a group of animals, there was really nothing that screamed “children’s book” to me. <br>If you are a fan of fantasy you should definitely check it out. I promise you won’t regret it. It is amazingly well written – it is not categorized as a classic for nothing!<br><br><strong>5 stars, all day long.</strong><br><span>[image error]</span></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></img></br></span>

<span id="freeText6530375908412055159" style="display:none">Some books have an amazingly unexplainable ability to transcend the purpose of their creation and take a leap into being an instant timeless classic.<blockquote>
<em>“All the world will be your enemy, Prince of a Thousand enemies. And when they catch you, they will kill you. But first they must catch you; digger, listener, runner, Prince with the swift warning. Be cunning, and full of tricks, and your people will never be destroyed.”</em>
</blockquote><em>Watership Down</em> began as an impromptu entertainment for Adams' two young daughters on long car trips - an adventure of a migrating bunch of somewhat anthropomorphic but yet very rabbit-like rabbits. It is a story full of palpable love for English countryside, full of 'rabbity' allegories of the variations of human societies and ideologies that nevertheless do not overshadow the simple but fascinating impact of the story of survival against all odds, rooted in friendship, bravery, loyalty, courage, quick thinking and learning, ability to see and embrace the new while relying on the ages-tested old, and perseverance despite the unfavorable odds.<blockquote>
<em>“Rabbits live close to death and when death comes closer than usual, thinking about survival leaves little room for anything else.”</em>
</blockquote>I first read the story of Hazel, Bigwig &amp; co. when I was twelve, and read it again and again many times since, loving it more and more with each re-read, appreciating more and more each time how its seeming simplicity is actually made of layers of complexity.<br><br><img class="escapedImg" src="https://p.gr-assets.com/540x540/fit/hostedimages/1391929339/8477118.jpg" width="350"><br><br>Survival is the big theme, naturally; but another one is the coexistence between the old ways and the new ways, the balance between the natural and the 'unnatural', innate and learned. (It's not just the rabbit society that is plagued by these choices, of course). On a superficial read, it would appear that Adams favors the former: our rabbits are looking for a way to lead the 'normal' natural rabbit life that sharply contrasts with the decadent Cowslip's warren and militaristic Efrafa. But on the other hand, it's precisely the openness to the new things and experiences that allows Hazel's bunch to survive: the raft and the boat, the digging of burrows, the interspecies alliances; but they still hold on firmly to their essential rabbitness.  It's the harmony that Adams is looking for, and I love it.<br><br>Adams succeeded in creating such vivid and distinct personalities for all of the rabbits in the story, making them so human-like and yet unmistakably animal at the same time. Cute fluffy bunnies they are not, however; they are tenacious survivalists full of life force and determination to survive despite their status as prey for the 'Thousand', the many carnivorous predators from cats to hawks to foxes to humans. They are driven by the need to live and multiply and thrive (and when allowed to do so, they are fearsome indeed - just think of how rabbits took over Australia, for example). In Adams' rendition, they are and aren't like us, and it's both their similarities and differences from what we think as 'human' that makes the story unforgettable. <blockquote>
<em>“Animals don't behave like men,' he said. 'If they have to fight, they fight; and if they have to kill they kill. But they don't sit down and set their wits to work to devise ways of spoiling other creatures' lives and hurting them. They have dignity and animality.” </em>
</blockquote>Each rabbit has a distinct voice and personality - <strong>without being *people* they are nevertheless *persons*</strong> - but it's the three that stand out to me: Hazel, Bigwig and Woundwort.<br><br>Hazel, the mastermind of the rabbit adventures, is a natural leader. He is not the fastest, the smartest or the strongest - but he has the understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of the ragtag bunch he leads. He genuinely cares, and his charisma and leading by example are quick to win the loyalty of others. The parallels between Hazel and the legendary rabbit folklore hero, El-ahrairah, the Prince of a Thousand enemies, are not surprising, and the final scene of the book, lovely but quietly gut-wrenching, comes as no surprise.<br><br><img class="escapedImg" src="https://p.gr-assets.com/540x540/fit/hostedimages/1391929340/8477119.jpg" width=" 400"><blockquote>
<em>"You needn't worry about them," said his companion. "They'll be all right -- and thousands like them. If you'll come along, I'll show you what I mean."<br>He reached the top of the bank in a single, powerful leap. Hazel followed; and together they slipped away, running easily down through the wood, where the first primroses were beginning to bloom."</br></em>
</blockquote>His opposite is the eventual villain of the book, General Woundwort, the tyrant leader of an isolated militaristic rabbit warren, a ruler with an iron fist, whose forceful personality is supplemented by ferociously merciless teeth and claws. Unlike Hazel, he leads by force and coercion - but props to Adams for not making him neatly fit into a black-and-white good-vs-bad model as his amazing ability to at least temporarily make rabbits, perpetual prey, into predators was a source of almost legendary fame. And yet Woundwort's vision breaks down because, grand as it may be, it's still just tunnel vision.<blockquote>
<em>“At that moment, in the sunset on Watership Down, there was offered to General Woundwort the opportunity to show whether he was really the leader of vision and genius which he believed himself to be, or whether he was no more than a tyrant with the courage and cunning of a pirate. For one beat of his pulse the lame rabbit's idea shone clearly before him. He grasped it and realized what it meant. The next, he had pushed it away from him.” </em>

Big, strong  and experienced and therefore bound to succeed almost anywhere in the rabbit 'society', he grows from a careless and a bit bullyish character to one strongly loyal and just, learning to rely on brains over brawn and yet with enough ferocity and determination to be an unstoppable force when combined with Hazel's leadership. <br><br>The warren of Watership Down would have been doomed without Bigwig's boundless daring loyal courage, without his resolute determination and willingness for self-sacrifice for the others - a trait he would, of course, have not developed if not for the friends he made on the night of the escape from the doomed old warren in the search of Watership Down promised by Fiver. Hazel learns to see the strengths and weaknesses in others; Bigwig learns to see them in himself.<br><br>My strong and loyal rabbit hero, your words at what you thought may have been your last minutes never cease to make me happily grin:<blockquote>
<em>“My Chief Rabbit has told me to stay and defend this run, and until he says otherwise, I shall stay here.”</em>

</img></br></br></blockquote>This book is wonderful, fantastic, and has definitely earned itself a spot on the strategically placed bookshelf in my future hypothetical daughter's room where it will serve the purpose of helping to bring her into the wonderful world of stories and help her see the world for the amazing place it is. <br><strong><br>And meanwhile, somewhere in the wild, rabbits would quietly go on with their rabbit lives.<blockquote><em>"Underground, the story continued."</em></blockquote></br></strong></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></img></img></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></img></br></br></span>

But first they must catch you, digger, listener, runner, prince with the swift warning. Be cunning and full of tricks and your people shall never be destroyed."</strong><br><br>When Fiver, a seer, is overcome with a vivid dream of mass destruction. He tries to convince the rabbits in charge of the validity of his vision. They are dismissive, but one rabbit named Hazel does believe him.  They convince nine other bucks to leave the warren with them. Driven by fear and curiosity they begin an odyssey that if Homer had been fortunate enough to hear about, would have given him another epic story to tell for a few more copper coins in the town square. <br><br><a href="http://s1183.photobucket.com/albums/x462/jkeeten/?action=view&amp;current=Bunnies.png" rel="nofollow">
<img alt="Photobucket" class="escapedImg" src="https://p.gr-assets.com/540x540/fit/hostedimages/1380381719/739118.png"/></a><br><br>Hazel finds out he is a natural leader and through courage, luck, and Macguveresque skills manages to bring his troop through the thickets of a new and dangerous world. They meet other warrens of rabbits with society aberrations that made them unpalatable for amalgamation.  Given the way that Richard Adams portrayed these rigid social constructs I came away with the feeling that he was somewhat anti-government.  He seemed to be advocating that a looser structure of co-existence will lead to happier rabbits/people. <br><br>Speaking of that, even though these rabbits did take on some human characteristics, I never really thought of them as people.  I was convinced I was reading a book about rabbits not rabbits with human faces. That to me is a major achievement, and at the same time in the early pages made me feel like I was reading a book at a reading level below my comfort zone. Rabbits are relatively simple animals and Adams adhered to that principle for most of the book. Cleverness was a revered trait among warren colonies and is reflected in their stories of past accomplishments by legendary rabbits.  These stories passed down orally from generation to generation provided a collective source of cunning skills that are applied to situations beyond the natural experiences of our erstwhile heroes. <br><br>It doesn't take long for the all male colony to realize that if they want kittens.<br><br><a href="http://s1183.photobucket.com/albums/x462/jkeeten/?action=view&amp;current=BabyBunny.jpg" rel="nofollow">

<img alt="playboybunniestail" class="escapedImg" src="https://p.gr-assets.com/540x540/fit/hostedimages/1380381719/739120.jpg"/></a><br><br>They were in such a hurry to escape the warren that they forgot to bring the mystical other half necessary for reproduction.  They came to the same conclusion that tribal units have come to for thousands of years.  If they don't have something they need than they need to liberate it from someone else.  The Efrafa warren is governed by General Woundwart. He is a brutal, militaristic leader who rules his burrow with an iron fist.  The Efrafa happen to have a plethora of DOES and Hazel and his band of intrepid bunnies believe they are clever enough, with the help of some unusual allies, to coax away enough DOES to insure the survival of their fledgling society.  <br><br>This sets up one of the most pulse pounding showdowns I've read in a long time.  Displaying the courage of the defenders of the Alamo and the steadfastness of the Spartans at the battle of Thermopylae I found myself glowing with the pride of a participant, white knuckles and all, as the Watership Down rabbits defend their home. <br><br>The thing about this book is that you have to hang in there.  I have started and stopped this book a handful of times, but several reviews on goodreads convinced me I was giving up on the book too soon.  At about page 70 I could feel my eyes looking over with longing at the stack of books waiting in the wings.  As the pages stacked up I started to care about this band of brothers. I wish that I had read it in time to have shared it with my kids.  There is much to be discussed especially in regards to how societies are structured, about courage, about friendship, about thinking outside the box, and about the importance of how we conduct ourselves within our own warren/township. If you have kids young enough, read it to them. It will heighten the experience for you and them.  I've already got this logged as a book to read to my grandchildren...some day...in the distant future...after my kids graduate college...get great jobs...meet their soulmates...and have kids that love to curl up in their grandfather's lap for a tale that may help shape the people they become.    <br><br><br><br><br/></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></span>

Feel free to disbelieve me if you must, but it's actually true. I know the person it happened to quite well, though I have changed names and other particulars in order to protect the innocent and not-so-innocent.<br><br>So, many years ago, my friend (let's call her Mary) used to have a dog (let's call him Rover). She lived next door to a family whose five year old girl (let's call her Anna) had a rabbit (let's call him Fluffy). Anna was extremely fond of Fluffy, and spent a lot time playing with him, feeding him lettuce, and doing other stuff five year old girls do with their pet rabbits.<br><br>One weekend, Anna's family were going off for a day to visit relatives. They had only been gone an hour or two when Mary's little sister bursts into her bedroom, close to hysterical. OMG, OMG, Rover has killed Fluffy! Mary comes downstairs, and it's true. There's Rover, looking very pleased with himself, and there's Fluffy. He's not just stone-cold dead, but Rover has for some reason dragged him home through the dirt, rather than carrying him carefully in his jaws the way dogs usually do. He's a total mess.<br><br>So for a moment both girls are indeed pretty hysterical, but then Mary calms down. She can see a way out of this. They take Fluffy's corpse back to Mary's room, and get out a bowl of warm water, shampoo and a blow-drier. They do a pretty good job of cleaning him up, so he looks more or less presentable. Late at night, they sneak out with a flashlight and put him back in his hutch. They figure that with a little luck they've got away with it.<br><br>The next day, the neighbors come back. Shortly afterwards, the doorbell rings. It's Anna's father, who looks like he's near to losing it altogether. At first he can hardly speak, he's so angry, and then he explains what's happened. They were just going to leave, he says, and Anna had gone out for a last check on Fluffy. She'd found him dead, and was, predictably, heart-broken. Despite everything, she'd insisted that they go and bury him properly at once, which they'd done. And then... while they were away... some <em>bastard</em>, some <em>sick fuck</em> had gone and <em>dug up</em> poor Fluffy! and <em>put him back in his hutch</em>!! How could anyone do such a thing!!!<br><br>My friend told me she'd looked him in the eye and said she couldn't understand that either, and it was the hardest thing she'd ever done.<br><br>*********************************************************<br><br>I just got mail from Eric_W, who pointed out that a variant of this story is described as an urban legend at <a href="http://www.snopes.com/horrors/gruesome/haredry.asp" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.snopes.com/horrors/gruesom...</a> <br><br>I heard this story from my friend, who is very reliable, early in 1987, which predates any of the references quoted... the Snopes article claims it started circulating the following year.

Now I was allowed at the big people's table. I was six years old. My brother Les-ten. and my sister Bonnie-fourteen. Every night after supper we all gathered around -after my mom, and us children cleared the dishes- my dad read a chapter or two each night. It was a time when life was PERFECT. It was before any stresses hit our world.<br><br><img class="escapedImg"><img alt=" photo 3b516edd-f78b-4daa-a88b-8e4b8c4ee352_zps7dc25b97.jpg" class="escapedImg" src="https://p.gr-assets.com/540x540/fit/hostedimages/1395156962/8956984.jpg"><br><br>WATERSHIP DOWN is about a young bunny named Fiver who is a seer. One day he receives a frightening vision of his warren's imminent destruction. When he and his brother Hazel fail to convince their chief rabbit of the need to evacuate, they set out on their own with a small band of rabbits to search for a new home. <br><br>I will just say that many of my childhood pets have been named after characters in this book (two dogs and two cats, named after Pipkin and Fiver).<br><br>Probably most people that read this book will not have the same experience that I did, but to me it was a welcoming into the adult world of reading.<br/></br></br></br></br></br></br></img></img></br></br></br></br></img></img></br></br></br></br></span>

This is the first time in probably a decade that I’ve actually spent any time on the day thinking about my dad. <br><br>He was pathologically inattentive. At best, my brothers and I were servants. At worst, helpless outlets for cruelty. He would hang out with us occasionally, but it ended in fighting every time. Every year, on this day, he’d get the obligatory “World’s Greatest Dad” t-shirt or whatever. I imagine that, sometimes, the sentiment was even genuine. I’m sure it was, now that I think about it. Fathers are important people.<br><br>I’ve been reading this book with my daughter, every night before bed. She calls it <em>The Bunny Book</em>. We’ve had lengthy discussions about Hazel and Fiver, Kehaar and Bigwig. We both delighted in the exploits of El-ahrairah, and were emotionally crushed whenever disaster befell our favorite warren. <br><br>To fall back on the comfort of cliche, life is all about the journey. The rabbits left their home because it was doomed. They faced many obstacles in their escape, but they <a class="jsShowSpoiler spoilerAction">(view spoiler)</a><span class="spoilerContainer" style="display: none">[ made it <a class="jsHideSpoiler spoilerAction">(hide spoiler)</a>]</span>. Perhaps that night with the police was my escape. Perhaps the nightmares and disappointments were my journey. Perhaps he was my General Woundwort. It doesn’t really matter, because, in the end, I'm happy where I ended up. I’ve got my girls. I have my life.<br><br>Perhaps Father’s Day isn’t about celebrating fathers. Perhaps it’s a chance for fathers to take stock of what they have and celebrate that. This year, I’m celebrating <em>The Bunny Book</em> and those late nights with my baby.<!--["br"]--><!--["br"]--><!--["br"]--><!--["br"]--><!--["br"]--><!--["br"]--><!--["br"]--><!--["br"]--></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></span>

(Anyone with a pulse and a beating heart that gives a shit about what is around them.) There's a lovely intro in a newer edition about how he "wrote" it with his children (the stories started out a spur-of-the-moment thing when prompted to tell them a story). It's meant to be interactive in a makes you think and makes you feel way. I certainly lose myself in this world whenever I reread (it's funny how quickly I can disassociate with the dangerous men). I did not get the impression that he disrespected his kid's input in any way either. They were his first listeners (as all past and future readers are, as well). The age of the reader is moot, just as the species of the characters is. <br>I found fascinating also how Adams researched how rabbits really behave, to keep it as close to their true natures as possible. Respect, again.<br>I feel the point of those efforts was dignity. One of the many things that Watership Down is about is the right to live with dignity. <br>Aren't some things what everyone could still use at any time? What is too much to pay for freedom? What is the cost of ignoring atrocities because it makes things easier for you (sounds like world affairs for like always)? Love, brotherhood, government, spirituality, what you need to hold on, adventure (Watership Down is also one of my favorite adventure stories), self respect. If you care about the essentials for another, then how can Watership Down ONLY be for one thing? How is giving a shit for kids only?<br>I'm not sure why the kid statements bother me (other than just being wrong). Maybe I feel it is meant to take away dignity from those rabbits. Put a genus tag on the book and file it away for the past.<br>Maybe it's the feeling of wonder before cynicism can kick in. But I was always cynical! Hard on the inside and soft on the outside like Paul McCartney. Or hard on the outside and soft on the inside like John Lennon. Hell, people are more complex than that. (So are rabbits!) Something else Watership Down has in no short supply is magic. <br>Because the world is bigger for them. It's easy to forget that it is still big when you get bigger.<br><br/></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></span>

It seemed like it had been too easy and anticlimactic. There were no female characters. I also felt that the theme of human impact being negative and destructive was a little too easy: novelists now, as then, have their environmental impact, as do we all. It's easy to suggest that humans are degrading their environment, harder to say what should be done about it given that we are all complicit in it - and Adams makes no effort at all in that direction.<br><br>Little did I suspect that this was just the pre-amble to a tremendous adventure in which this theme would be dropped almost entirely and the focus would shift toward questions of leadership, governance and the will to power. Or that the lack of female rabbits would turn out to be crucial to what was going to happen next.<br><br>Now, a bunch of talking rabbits should really be laughable, but they really aren't. How does Adams acheive this? Partly by creating convincing characters, something that is, of course, crucial to the success of any novel but that doesn't resolve the absurdity of talking rabbits. One method adopted by Adams is to remember that they are rabbits, not just metamorphosed humans, which one might think would be counter-productive but turns out not to be. So these rabbits behave like rabbits and where human cultural attitudes conflict with the general behaviour of rabbits, rabbit behaviour is kept. Rabbit behaviour is also described in detail, from a position of knowledge. But here's what makes the whole thing really work: The rabbits have a language, folk-tales, myths, legends and religion all their own. The floaty black rabbit from the film symbolises death and in the book is a good deal less floaty, more corporeal and even more scary. This doesn't stop the vaguely Promethean Ancestor-Father-Trickster-Rabbit of rabbit legend taking him on, though!<br><br>This matter of a society having history that merges into myth and legend, language that is convincingly represented, religious or spiritual elements to its culture seems to me to be a common factor linking the best works of fantasy (and what is more fantastical than a bunch of talking bunnies?). People talk about world-building in relation to fantasy and SF. I would suggest that these aspects of the world to be built are crucial.<br><br>The rabbit-language is so well handled that when Bigwig tells his nemesis to "Silflay hraka," it has all the offensive force of any crude one-liner a Hollywood action star has ever delivered and suits the moment perfectly. Was that in the film? I can't remember, but it should be! This happens during a denouement that has several perfect moments and becomes another folk-tale added to the rich store of stories kept in the warrens of the Lapines.<br><br>So the wobbly start of parts 1 and 2 turns out in part to be well thought out and necessary for what comes later and in part just forgetable once stuck into the drama of parts 3 and 4, where even the humans turn out to be not all bad after all.<!--["br"]--><!--["br"]--><!--["br"]--><!--["br"]--><!--["br"]--><!--["br"]--><!--["br"]--><!--["br"]--><!--["br"]--><!--["br"]--><!--["br"]--><!--["br"]--><!--["br"]--><!--["br"]--></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></span>

<strong>"I announce with trembling pleasure the appearance of a great story."</strong>
</em><br><br>In 1972, an unknown British novelist named Richard Adams published his debut novel with a rather misleading title, <em>Watership Down</em>. After being rejected <em>13 times</em> by various publisher it was finally accepted by Rex Collings, a one-man company which worked on a shoestring and couldn't pay Adams any advance, but had important connections in the London literary scene and made sure that it was read by everyone who mattered. Rex Collings believed in <em>Watership Down</em>; Adams credits him as the person who helped give the book its title (apparently he thought that <em>Hazel &amp; Fiver</em> didn't do it justice). Everything seemed to suggest that the whole affair would be an abject failure. <em>Watership Down</em> was a debut work by an unknown novelist, published at a high price by a small fry who could afford only a plain dust jacket. Collings published his books in small print runs, which were then sold in specialist bookshops with little or no publicity, and the initial print run of <em>Watership Down</em> amounted to just 2000 copies. But this seemingly ugly duckling soon transformed into a beautiful swan; It sold quickly both to children and adults. Britain fell in love with <em>Watership Down</em>, and with time so did the whole world. Now tourists from as far as Japan journeying to Richard Adam's homeland to see the areas which inspired their favorite book. The quotation which opens this review comes from London's <em>The Times</em>, where the reviewer was barely able to contain his enthusiasm. <br><br><em>Watership Down</em> originally began as a serial bedtime story told by Richard Adams to his two little girls, Juliet and Rosamund. Adams later expanded it during long car journeys that he took with the girls to Stratford-upon-Avon, birthplace of the world's most famous bard. The story was improvised, but based on Adams's real life experience in the British Army. Adams served as a lieutenant in the 250 Company of the 1st Airborne Division, and named the Battle of Arnhem as inspiration, and the officers he served with as models for Hazel, Bigwig and other rabbits of <em>Watership Down</em>. When the story was finished, young Juliet said "you ought to write it down daddy, it's too good to waste!". Although Adams initially resisted, being busy with work in the Civil Service, she and her sister were very persistent in urging him to write it as a book until he finally surrendered, and then urged him to get it published. Watership Down is rightfully dedicated to these two girls, who were so generous as to make sure that their dad would share the story they loved with the whole world.<br><br><em>Watership Down</em> was initially rejected on the grounds that older children wouldn't like it, since it was about rabbits - which they thought was good for babies, and younger children wouldn't like it because it was written in too adult a style. Before Rex Collings decided to give it a try, Richard Adams experienced plenty of frustration with explaining that he didn't even had children in mind and that <em>Watership Down</em> was really about Hazel &amp; Fiver and their rabbits, a book which anyone, young or old, could buy and enjoy, and that the age group of his audience could roughly be contained between 8 and 88. It is interesting to note that <em>Watership Down</em> is sold also as a children's book only in the UK - everywhere else in the world it's sold purely as a mainstream title for adults.<br><br><em>
<strong>"El-ahrairah, your people cannot rule the world, for I will not have it so. All the world will be your enemy, Prince With A Thousand Enemies, and whenever they catch you, they will kill you. But first, they must catch you, digger, listener, runner, prince with the swift warning. Be cunning and full of tricks and your people shall never be destroyed."</strong>
</em><br><br>Rabbits are prey animals, and in the wilderness almost everything will try to capture and eat them; predators include foxes, dogs, hawks, racoons, owls, snakes - and humans. Luckily for them, nature has provided the rabbit with several features allowing for survival against these odds. Rabbits have eyes on both sides of their heads which give them nearly panoramic vision, allowing for detecting predators from all directions - even from behind. They can hear and smell exceptionally well, and are able to turn their ears to better capture the sounds they're listening to. Since making noises is a dead giveaway of their position, rabbits communicate with each other quietly, with the position of their ears being an important part of the rabbit language.<br><br>As useful as these may be, rabbits cannot survive on sight, smell and hearing alone. And this is why nature has endowed the rabbit with its best feature - ability to achieve amazing speed very quickly. Most of their mass consists of muscle, and their strength is focused in their long hind legs - they allow them to leap as high as one meter and as far as three. An average rabbit can run between 25 to 40 miles per hour, make quick turns and even turn directions while in the air, leaving other animals in the dust.<br><br>However, even this magnificent speed is not enough to protect the rabbit. Due to their low skeletal mass rabbits are very delicate and prone to injury, and can easily break their own bones if they struggle. If they kick to hard, they can even break their own backs. Stress can have a long lasting effect on a rabbit, even after its source is removed - and fear can cause a heart attack, even if the threat is not real. Their physical and psychological fragility and proneness to being preyed upon made the rabbit need a safe place to live. Some species live above ground, but the best know one - the European rabbit - digs burrows underground, and connects them into a network which is called a warren. In these warrens rabbits find safe shelter from their predators and harsh weather, store food and have their young. When they're not feeding, European rabbits spend most of their time underground.<br><br>The rabbits of <em>Watership Down</em> are very much like ordinary rabbits - Richard Adams has studied Ronald Lockley <em>The Private Life of the Rabbit</em> - but at the same time they're human like, with each having a distinct personality and different characteristics. While Adams clearly anthropomorphizes his bunnies, he doesn't go the easy way of making them humans in bunny suits. His rabbits' understanding of the world around them is carefully limited to make them lapine enough - men are identified by the "white sticks" they leave behind (almost every human character in the novel smokes - it <em>were</em> the 70's). human inventions are understood through the mind of a rabbit, and the challenges they experience on their way are also of the type which would trouble one. All of it works splendidly though, and the language that the rabbits developed to describe everything is a small joy to see.<br><br>Among many things which I found lovable and admirable in the rabbit protagonists of <em>Watership Down</em> is their love of stories. Rabbits love gathering together and listening to the tales of the legendary rabbit hero, their beloved El-ahrairah. El-ahrairah was a rabbit trickster and the legendary Prince of the Forest, who lived long before Hazel, Fiver and the rest of all rabbits. Together with his fellow rascal, Rabscutle, El-ahrairah uses his ample wits to commit plenty of mischief: getting lettuce out of an impenetrable fortress, outsmarting bigger and stronger creatures to achieve his goals. El-ahrairah is fast, cunning and proud, but he's also honorable and loyal to his people. The stories of El-ahrairah and his adventures are sprinkled throughout the main narrative, and serve as inspiration and entertainment for the rabbits, and as a way to find courage in hard times.<br><br>A reviewer in the <em>New Statesman</em> praised Richard Adams for writing a big, tense, picaresque story; these three adjectives probably best describe <em>Watership Down</em>. People have seen in it a riff on <em>The Oddysey</em>, an allegory for human struggle against totalitarian oppression, fascism, the Cold War...but at its heart it is a wonderful story about a group of rabbits searching for a new home, and their efforts at establishing a warren. They provide for interesting protagonists, and as they journey goes on so do their respective roles develop. These are to a degree archetypal, but Richard Adams is careful to make sure that each rabbit retains its individual characteristics and grow as the story progresses. Relations between the characters are not black and white, as in many books for children - even though the villain figure is portrayed with obvious negativity Adams makes an effort to show why it would be influential and admired by many other rabbits, all the way to the very end. Occasionally Adams will do some authorial intrusion and explain the rabbit habits of his protagonists, but he did write this book based on the stories he told their kids, and they probably asked many questions concerning these matters - as most kids would. It's not a big problem at all and can actually be seen a nice reminded about the roots of <em>Watership Down</em>.<br><br>It feels as if I have been writing this review for a very long time and have barely said anything I wanted to say. This happens when I encounter something which moves me and inspires me, and which stays with me and makes me experience and think and feel my humanity by doing so. Curiously, these feelings have been aroused by a book about a group of talking rabbits. But it works! By God, people, it works. Since it's summer I started to enjoy reading in a park near my home, just sitting on a bench away from the main lane in the quiet and the shade. This was where I started and finished <em>Watership Down</em>, and after I cleaned my eyes I wanted to immediately begin it all over again. I can't remember the last time that happened, and it's a great feeling. I can't wait to run down this burrow again and see what else I'll find there.Praise be to Richard Adams for being a wonderful father to his two little girls and a great writer who shared his beautiful book with us. <strong>5 stars.</strong><br><br>Be sure not to miss <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUBrxPMntG4" rel="nofollow">an interview with Richard Adams</a>, which made me like and appreciate <em>Watership Down</em> even more and want to seek out all his other works. It was filmed in November 2012 at Whitchurch Arts Show in the UK, where he's rocking the house at the age of 92. What a wonderful and lovable man! May he live a thousand years.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></span>

<span id="freeText15397562526916134002" style="display:none">It was the summer of 1986 when, rumaging through the long unused bedrooms of my grandfather's house, I stumbled upon the book Watership Down.  At twelve, I was at that wonderful age when any book was a source of fascination rather than embarrassment, and so I sat upon my uncle's old bed and, in the dusty sunlight streaming through the window,  began to read a book which would stay with me years later.<br><br>Fiver, a small and nervous rabbit, is plaugued by visions of the coming destruction of Sandleford Warren, his home.  His brother Hazel, convinced that Fiver is right, recruits other "outskirters" (male rabbits who are relegated to the fringe of warren life) to leave in hopes of finding a new home.  The story follows this rag-tag group as they endure predators, hardship, disease, and most horribly of all, brutality visited upon them by their own kind.  Over all, they also face that most inimical enemy to wildlife, Man.<br><br>The characters are what truly stand out in this novel:  The quietly competent leader Hazel, the gruff warrior Bigwig, the clever, innovative Blackberry, dashing storyteller Dandelion, the impulsive Silver, the steady Captain Holly,  timidly loyal Pipkin, and the insightful seer Fiver.  A host of other characters met along the way, especially the foul-mouthed seagull Kehaar, stay with you long after putting the book down. Through it all, the rabbits (and other species encountered), while anthropomorphized enough to sympathize with their struggle, still retain  their uniquely animal characteristics.   <br><br>I have heard the book dismissed as "that book about rabbits" or, more often, as "just a kid's book."  Perhaps Mr. Addams did in fact intend it to be literature for children;  However, I'm inclined to agree with C.S. Lewis, who was of the opinion that good literature is accessible to everyone, child and adult alike.  Watership Down, more than any other novel I have read, fits the bill.<br><br/></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></span>

<span id="freeText1319667602927623720" style="display:none">Most reviews I write just for the hell of it, for my own records and if some people like them I am just happy as a lark. For <em>Watership Down</em> however, I am just a little bit more ambitious. I would like to convince people who feel averse to reading a novel for children about rabbits to drop their preconception and give this book a chance. This is not a book about cute little bunnies running around eating carrots and being adorable 24/7. This is one of the most badass books I have ever read, and I have read books by <a href="http://www.goodreads.com/author/show/276660.Joe_Abercrombie" title="Joe Abercrombie">Joe Abercrombie</a> and <a href="http://www.goodreads.com/author/show/346732.George_R_R__Martin" title="George R.R. Martin">George R.R. Martin</a>. More importantly this is simply one of the all time great reads (in my humble estimation of course) that will stay with the readers for the rest of their days. Why, I have a memory like a sieve and I still remember it after all these years (OK, I have just reread it so that helps!) <br><br>It all starts with a psychic bunny (stop laughing back there!) called Fiver who has a vague premonition of impending death and destruction coming to his warren. He convinces his best friend Hazel and a few other rabbits to leave the warren for a safer place to live (their attempt to start a total evacuation is quickly nixed by the Chief Rabbit). The first half of the book tells the story of the rabbit motley crew’s (or mötley crüe if you prefer) difficult journey from their warren to find a safe location to start a new warren. The second half is about their defence of their new warren against an older bigger warren ruled by a despotic dictator called Woundwort who is something of a monstrous mutant mega rabbit. Interspersed between the chapters are charming and wonderful folk tales about the adventures of a legendary hero called El-ahrairah.<br><br>Plot, world building and characterisation are brilliantly balanced in this book. Even at almost 500 pages there is never a dull moment. Those looking for action adventures should really check out this book. There are hair raising chase scenes, espionage scenes, interspecies alliances, and a bloody fight scene that should be read with Survivor’s "Eye of the Tiger" playing in the background. On the characterisation side it is worth noting that the rabbits in this book are not anthropomorphized animals, they do not wear clothes, drive cars, watch TV etc. Yet there is also much humanity in their rabbitry, they can be compassionate, loving, kind, cruel, egotistical, melancholy etc. These humans traits are believably portrayed as rabbit traits through the incredible talent of Richard Adams. The prose is absolutely beautiful with wonderful metaphors like “an indestructible flood of rabbitry”. I can pick a great passage out of almost every page. Here is one awe-inspiring example:<blockquote>
<em>Many human beings say that they enjoy the winter, but what they really enjoy is feeling proof against it. For them there is no winter food problem. They have fires and warm clothes. The winter cannot hurt them and therefore increases their sense of cleverness and security. For birds and animals, as for poor men, winter is another matter.</em>
</blockquote> To further distinguish rabbits from other species a little neologism is employed throughout the book, most of the words can be understood from the context they are used, if you want some extra help with these you can check out this <a href="http://watershipdown.wikia.com/wiki/Lapine_Glossary" rel="nofollow">Lapine_Glossary</a>. You can even gloss over them without missing a beat of the book.<br><br>Reading this book is a little like taking a magic potion and transforming into a wee rabbit. I am not normally all that interested in cute animals but after reading this book I really developed a huge respect for these little guys, the odds are really stacked against them yet they manage to survive and even thrive. Even though the book was written primarily for children, it is certainly sophisticated enough to be enjoyed by adults. I certainly prefer it to all the YA books I have read.<br><br>Definitely worth more stars than the Goodreads system can accommodate.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></span>

<span id="freeText14636870028590382210" style="display:none"><br><em> "Our children's children will hear a good story."<br>	Rabbit proverb </br></em><br><br>I don't have any children of my own, but if I had, I know <strong> Watership Down </strong> would be at the top of the list of books to gift them with. On the back cover it is described as "one of the most beloved novels of our time", and for once the marketing hyperbole turns out to be justified. It would take a major Grinch to remain unmoved by the adventures of Hazel, Fiver, Bigwig, Blackberry, Dandelion et all. These critters have managed to burrow their way into my heart, and will probably remain hidden there for a long time.<br><br>It took me a really long time to actually start on the book. It wasn't on any of my school curriculums, and even after I discovered in 1990 that Richard Adams is a great storyteller, I couldn't see how a novel about a bunch of rabbits could compete with the bloody tale of a giant bear being worshipped as God (Shardik) or with the spicy, decadent allure of a fifteen year old prostitute (Maya). A couple of recent authors ( Catherynne Valente, Neil Gaiman, Charles de Lint) have been a real help in my reassessment of the power of myths and fairytales, and given me the final push towards this lapine version of the <em> Aeneid</em><br><br>Here's the quote from de Lint that explains some of the importance and fascination with the fables of El-ahrairah - the trickster folk hero of the rabbit world, who cleverly turns every misfortune into an opportunity and who guides his people through a world filled with a thousand enemies. He's Loki, Anansi, Robin Hood and Bugs Bunny rolled into one, and the tales of his exploits are not just a pleasant way of spending a quiet evening, but the source of courage and determination and wisdom that will give Hazel and his warren on Watership Down their chance to survive predators on two or four legs.<br><br><em> “People who’ve never read fairy tales have a harder time coping in life than the people who have. They don’t have access to all the lessons that can be learned from the journeys through the dark woods and the kindness of strangers treated decently, the knowledge that can be gained from the company and example of Donkeyskins and cats wearing boots and steadfast tin soldiers. I’m not talking about in-your-face lessons, but more subtle ones. The kind that seep up from your subconscious and give you moral and humane structures for your life. That teach you how to prevail, and trust. And maybe even love.” </em><br><br>I don't want to get into a detailed description of the plot and of each character. The reference to the Aeneid is not gratuitous, as the heroes have to survive the destruction of their original home (Troy) , heed prescient oracles of doom (Fiver as Cassandra), travel to the edges of the known world battling imposssible odds, kidnap some wifes for their male dominated group (the Romans and the Sabines) and finish with an epic battle against a superior force. The rabbits are individualized not so much by their physical atributes, as by their character traits - courage, wisdom, steadfastness, inventiveness, etc. This makes it easier to anthropomorphise and identify with their plight. More than anything else in the novel, I liked the companionship and the readiness for self-sacrifice in the interest of the group, each rabbit doing his small part according to his abilities and depending on the others in time of need - a social grace that is endangered in the age of the atomic family , and with more and more people living single and isolated in their cubbyholes or in front of TV and computer screens.<br><br><em> 'Wisdom is found on the desolate hillside, El-ahrairah, where none comes to feed, and the stony bank where the rabbit scratches a hole in vain. </em><br><br>The theme of growing up through dealing with adversity is central to the story, with equally interesting developments about the nature of leadership ( Hazel vs. General Woundwort) and the danger of sacrificing personal freedom for security (the social structures at Elfafa vs Watership Down). These lessons are not put down in speeches or lengthy disertations, but are extracted from the actions of the actors and the results of these actions. Adams is a firm believer in the 'show don't tell' school of writing, in the oral traditions of storytelling handed down from prehistoric time. The book has a lively pace and a well graded racketing up of dramatic tension. I finished the book in almost record time between day job and evening housework, staying up late into the night for one chapter after another.<br><br>Finally, a few words about the setting. South-central England is where Richard Adams grew up and all the places described here can be identified on a map and visited. I wish I could name every hedge flower and every bird and insect that I meet on my country walks as well as Adams does, describe the weather and the sounds and the smells as well he does here, and study the habits of the wildlife with as much dedication. The wonders of nature are part of the thrill of the journey just as much as the more picaresque adventures of the small and furry heroes.<br/></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></span>

<span id="freeText470796777578758541" style="display:none">Adapted from ISawLightningFall.blogspot.com<br><br><em>Watership Down</em> has a lot in common with the ancient epics. In it, a lone warrior leads a band of harried outcasts into the wilderness in search of a home. They’re aided by a seer who can touch the future with his dreams. They face perilous quests and hair-breadth escapes, ferocious foes and desperate siege assaults. But unlike the works of Homer and Virgil, <em>Watership Down</em> is also about rabbits. Which is appropriate, as almost all of its characters are rabbits.<br><br>Most four-footed protagonists in literature have been little more than humans with fur. (Think <em>Stuart Little</em> or <em>Redwall</em>.) But Adams takes a very different tack, which is evident from the get-go. The tale begins with two young rabbits named Hazel and Fiver living in a peaceful warren ruled by an old veteran named the Threarah. Scrawny, meditative Fiver has premonitions of doom falling on them all, a doom that will stain the fields with rabbit blood. But when the Threarah ignores Fiver’s counsel, Hazel decides to rouse anyone he can and flee. The two are joined by Bigwig (a massive bruiser once part of the Threarah’s personal guard), Dandelion (a storyteller par excellence), Blackberry (the smart-as-a-whip innovator) and Pipkin (a loyal but timid runt). When the Threarah’s minions discover their plans, the motley crew must plunge into the wilds under threat of death.<br><br>Adams’ break with Disney-esque anthropomorphizing becomes even more apparent in the culture he created for his rabbits. Much like Tolkien did in <a href="http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34.The_Lord_of_the_Rings" title="The Lord of the Rings by J.R.R. Tolkien">The Lord of the Rings</a>, Adams created a language with its own detailed grammar and vocabulary. An example: Fiver’s true name, Hrairoo, comes from hrair, the term for any number over four, which is how high rabbits can count. They call these greater sums "thousand," and Fiver's name literally means "little thousand." He was so christened because he was small and one of the last born in his litter. Other words that crop up -- including elil (“predators”), silflay (“to graze”) and narn (“something good to eat”) -- possess equally detailed explanations. Frith, the word for the sun, is particularly interesting since it contains religious connotations. The rabbits, you see, are sun worshippers. They adore Lord Frith and the first rabbit he created, El-ahrairah, whose mischievous exploits get recounted several times in detail and who would put Odysseus to shame with his inventiveness.<br><br>Part of the joy of reading <em>Watership Down</em> lies in not only in its mythological color, but in letting yourself be carried along by every twist and turn of the plot, which is half adventure and half thriller (with a smattering of British botany, warren geography and seagull dialect thrown in to keep things interesting). If you find it hard to believe that it could be a coherent read with so many disparate elements (much less an entertaining one), join the crowd. It took months of nagging from a friend to get me to crack its cover. But it most certainly works, which is a testimony to Adams’ skill, as is the fact that when you reach the final page, you’ve begun to feel that Hazel and his friends are every bit as courageous as Achilles or Aeneas -- no matter the length of their ears.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></span>

A soothsaying crazy rabbit has visions of a rabbit den awash in blood and strange monsters (machines) attacking the land. A few believers follow him to found a new warren. Along the way, they fall in with and are tempted by a few other tribes of bunnies, each twisted in its own weird way (including the common trope of the false paradise, where everything is apparently "taken care of" for the rabbits by mysterious outside forces, which Justin Cronin totally ripped off in <a href="http://www.goodreads.com/review/show/96947927">The Passage</a>), before they eventually determine to start anew. <br><br>Woven throughout is a whole language and mythology for the rabbits, including a sort of creation myth, that I always found a little boring when I was younger but appreciated more when I picked it up a few years ago -- they give the proceedings an additional layer of allegory and keep it from being just a cute kid's story (which, don't get me wrong, it still mostly is).<br><br>Because yes, it does work on an allegorical level, but it's really only worth analyzing as such if you're in middle school, since the allegories are pretty obvious and not very deep (quiz question: what political system/real world figure is represented by the rabbit colony Efrafra and its tyrannical leader, General Woundwart? Is it Stalin? It's Stalin, isn't it?). Better to appreciate it as a great adventure with endearing characters and an interesting pseudo-mythology. <br><br>Unless you're a girl, because all the female rabbits are super lame.<br><br><em>Facebook 30 Day Book Challenge Day 20: Book you've read the most number of times.</em></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></span>

Oh, god, please let this book get better since there are 350 more pages left to go.<br><br><u>Edit:</u><br>Since people keep on finding this review and balking at it, let me just say that I found the book to be beautifully written. However, I just didn't find any characters I particularly cared for, and the storyline just wasn't interesting to me. I watched the movie just to see if it would be worth it to read the book, and I had the same reaction. It just wasn't interesting.  I'm not a big fan of journey-type narratives or anthropomorphic stories. I'm a prolific reader of everything from classics to sci-fi. I read a lot of children's literature. I taught American literature for 10 years. And I also know what I like and what I don't. This just happens to be a book that doesn't appeal to me.  Perhaps it speaks to you. Every book is different for every person. Every person brings in different experiences that allows a book to speak to them in a different way. If we all liked the same things, the world would be a terribly boring place. My feelings toward this book should not be a personal affront to you who counts it among your favorites. My one star is personal and has little to do with the author's ability to write or others' possibility of liking it. One star simply means that it doesn't appeal to me in the least. Calm down and move on.  </br></br></br></span>

I initially thought I'd be overcome with unintentional laughter and an inability to suspend my disbelief.  I thought wrong.  By the book's end, when this ragtag collection of refugees from the obliterated Sandleford warren reaches the end of their journey, I was figuratively elevating Mr Adams to the gold medal platform of fantasy writers, just above  even the Holy Trinity of Tolkien, Lewis, and Rowling.  Seriously.<br><br>In creating a new world with its own culture, history, and folklore, nothing matches Watership Down's consistent inventiveness.  Interestingly, this is a lean world, devoid of unnecessarily intricate machinations or cluttered details reflective of authorial indulgence.  The characters are each distinct, richly drawn, yet refreshingly free of cliche.  There are heroes and villains to be sure--"good" and "bad" rabbits as well as other animated creatures--but none lack depth or interest, none descend into parody.  The storytelling pace, furthermore, is brisk, consistent, always thrilling.  In short, I, without reservation, recommend this book to that broadest of all demographic groupings: children of all ages.    </br></br></span>

<span id="freeText4926641770699812679" style="display:none">I watched the 1978 cartoon adaptation of <em>Watership Down</em> when I was quite young, under 10 years old. I wasn't told beforehand that the film wasn't going to be your typical cartoon adventure about rabbits, so the mature themes and, particularly, the brutality and bloodshed left an indelible mark on my growing brain. There are frames from this film that I can still see clearly in my mind's eye decades after viewing it.<br><br>I've always been curious about the book and, for reasons unknowable to me, I just recently got around to picking it up. Based on my memories of the film version, I was expecting <em>Game of Thrones</em> with rabbits. I was expecting a relentless parade of death and despair. This isn't what I got. Yes, this is a mature book, and it is realistic and honest about the rabbit's place in the world, and it certainly doesn't shy away from the realities of their place in the food chain. But I was expecting crushing tragedy after crushing tragedy, and what I got was a much more balanced depiction of the rabbit's life. <br><br>I wasn't disappointed that my expectations didn't match this book's contents.<br><br>This was a slower read for me. But this, I have to admit can be, at least in part, attributed to the circumstances surrounding my reading of the book. I was extremely busy while reading this, and the only time I had to read was just before bed. The book didn't keep me up. I was out in under fifteen minutes almost every night (after the old Kindle slapped me in the face multiple times as I nodded off). But, structurally, it didn't <em>feel</em> like a novel. It felt like a collection of interconnected stories (or a fix-up) until about the halfway mark, when we're, at long last, introduced to the book's central conflict. Another aspect of the book that slowed it down for me was the stories within the story about rabbit folklore. These stories, in themselves, I found entertaining, but they did kill the momentum for me every time.<br><br>Overall, I enjoyed this book a great deal, and I think it will be one that will stick in my memory for years to come. It's a rich book with a layered narrative. There are beautiful passages sprinkled throughout. An obvious respect for nature and a passion for nature's beauty serves as a nice contrast to the harrowing events of the story. The narrative is at first biblical in tone, then dystopian. It veers suddenly into a heist story, returns again to dystopian mode, and finally settles into a tale of all-out resource war. Sprinkled between all of these shifts in narrative structure, there are stories within the main story, stories told between rabbits: their creation myths, tall tales of their legendary heroes, stories of what lies beyond death and the Black Rabbit who is waiting there to greet all rabbits when they stop running.<br><br>I'd certainly recommend this book. However, know that this is one to be sipped, not gulped.<br/></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></span>

I guess that in a story about a bunch of rabbits, it could be easy to mistake one for the other. Not in this book. Each of the main rabbits has a distinct character, and throughout the book I found that I actually really cared about them. I can't really say much more about the characters without giving the storyline away, but suffice to say that it was a rollercoaster of emotions.<br><br>The story carries deeper meaning than just a story about rabbits. It's a tale of survival, team-work, friendship and perseverance. I think that this message is a valid one for adults and children alike, and that at some point EVERYONE should read this book. I can't believe that I didn't read it in my childhood.</br></br></br></br></br></br></span>

<span id="freeText2759586030046445651" style="display:none"><strong>Here's to Ralph Cosham, the Brit who superbly narrated this book (and several other audiobooks that I love). He died in 2014.</strong><br><br><strong>For the love of lagomorphs — rabbits are not of the rodent family — who live each day on the edge.</strong> This story is fantastical yet feels oddly real, perhaps because it is based in observed rabbit behaviors (with some exceptions).  Adams makes use of anthropomorphism and allegory to enrich an otherwise straightforward story. With vivid imagery, pathos, suspense, and a touch of the spiritual, it appeals to adults and children..<br><br><strong>Scary:</strong> The book is classified as juvenile fiction, but it may be too scary for younger kids.  Lots of bloody and graphic fight scenes, with fangs and claws. Crows attempting to peck at eyeballs. Dogs and cats attacking. A fearsomely vicious rabbit buck. Death. <br><br><strong>Reading Tools and Tips:</strong> To keep the many characters straight, I referred to a list at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Watership_Down_characters" rel="nofollow">Wikipedia</a>. The author alternately refers to rabbits by their birth name, which is in rabbit speak (Lapine) and also by their nickname. For example, little Pipkin is also referred to by his Lapine name <em>Hlao-Roo.</em> Also, a <strong>glossary of Lapine words </strong> is listed at the foot of this review, inside a spoiler tag. (The definitions are from the back of the e-book.) Plus, try the <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/quizzes/results?id=5719-watership-down">quiz,</a> created by Emily Holmes.<br><br><strong>Key words:</strong> One Lapine word that appears to absurd excess is "hraka" for "rabbit droppings" -- these bucks can't make a move without first stopping to pass <em>hraka</em> (analyze that). Another frequent word is "silflay" which means "graze on grass" -- coming up out of the burrow at dawn and dusk, the times when all wild rabbits indeed do graze, or silflay. When rabbits go "tharn" they freeze, paralyzed with fear.  Also, the Lapine word for "catastrophic death or destruction" is "zorn" -- shouted several times in the story, especially after attack by "elil" (enemies of all kinds).<br><br><strong>Plot Summary:</strong> The story is set in Berkshire, England, in a real place in the countryside, called Watership Down. It begins at the Sandleford warren, where Fiver, a prophetic and undersized young buck, warns of catastrophic destruction. Fiver's capable older brother Hazel heeds the warning, and leads 11 bucks away.  Several miles later, frightened and exhausted, they join Cowslip's wonderful warren — until they learn the horrible truth. They take to the fields again, and finally, their long dangerous journey — similar to <a href="http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1381.The_Odyssey" title="The Odyssey by Homer">The Odyssey</a> — ends at Watership Down. These lonely high hills offer the perfect place to dig a new warren. Now only one problem remains: They have no does. No does = no babies = no future. So off they go to find some does, discovering a GREAT EVIL in the meadow, where Woundwort rules in a terror comparative to <a href="http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18131.A_Wrinkle_in_Time" title="A Wrinkle in Time by Madeleine L'Engle">A Wrinkle in Time</a>,  <a href="http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/5129.Brave_New_World" title="Brave New World by Aldous Huxley">Brave New World</a>, and <a href="http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/5470.1984" title="1984 by George Orwell">1984</a>.  With trepidation, Hazel's bucks fight to free some desperate does from Woundwort's warren (Efrafa), confronting fearsome beasties and terrifying phenomena such as trains...<br><br>Also, the story includes legends of El-ahrairah, Prince with a Thousand Enemies, the first rabbit from the dawn of creation. These homeless rabbits draw strength, comfort, and inspiration from this folk hero, for the beloved buck is daring and clever, outwitting his endless enemies. The myths of El-hairah also include the rabbit god, Frith (the sun) and the Black Rabbit (a grim reaper). Excerpt:<blockquote>
<strong>“All the world will be your enemy, Prince with a Thousand Enemies, and whenever they catch you, they will kill you. But first they must catch you, digger, listener, runner, prince with the swift warning. Be cunning and full of tricks and your people shall never be destroyed." </strong>
</blockquote><br><strong>My response: </strong>I was fairly captivated. The writing is beautiful and the story gripping (except for some minor pacing problems). I enjoyed the analogies and loved watching the rabbits form a tight bond and grow in character. Because rabbits are by nature fearful prey animals, I could almost taste their desperation as they traveled across open country in search of a safe warren. I could almost hear their hind feet thumping, warning of danger from earth and sky.  When they finally get a chance to kick back and relax,  I breathed a sigh of relief too.  ツ I grew to love these rabbits. Rabbits run free on our land. I'm no expert, but they do behave much as depicted here. I also enjoyed learning to speak Lapine. Adams created a clever language. Clever as they are, I felt that all the <strong>legends</strong> about El-ahrairah interrupted the plot. There are at least five legends, each one an entire chapter. However, the legends are used to inspire the rabbits to solve problems, and they are quite good.<br><br><strong>But IMO, the best aspect of this book is the character development</strong>. Nicely done! If not for <strong>Hazel,</strong> they might not have made it, but Hazel counted on his whole team, especially his wonderful loving brother <strong>Fiver,</strong> who can see into the future and hear warnings of danger, supposedly straight from Lord Frith (the sun, their god). Together, Hazel and Fiver are unbeatable, winning every buck's trust, until eventually Hazel is dubbed Hazel-Rah (leader, prince, royal).   Hazel is not perfect (thank Frith for that -- unflawed heroes are boring)  but he learns from his mistakes. His greatest strengths are his willingness to put himself at risk for his friends, his shrewd wit (for example, befriending non-rabbits) and his easy-going leadership style. Hazel's introduction: <blockquote>"Although he was a yearling and still below full weight, he had not the harassed look of most "outskirters"... He looked as though he knew how to take care of himself. There was a shrewd, buoyant air about him as he sat up, looked around and rubbed both front paws over his nose. As soon as he was satisfied that all was well, he laid back his ears and set to work on the grass.</blockquote>Hazel also counted on <strong>Bigwig,</strong> whose Lapine name is Thlayli, which means "fur head" (see the mohawk-like tuft between his ears).  This big buck grew in character across the chapters. At first too brash, he becomes more of a team player, more reflective and kind, and in the end, utterly loveable and sacrificial. This early portrayal of Bigwig changes drastically over the course of the story: <a class="jsShowSpoiler spoilerAction">(view spoiler)</a><span class="spoilerContainer" style="display: none">[<blockquote>Hazel felt at a loss. In front of him stood Bigwig, sodden wet, undaunted, single-minded — the very picture of decision. At his shoulder was Fiver, silent and twitching. He saw Blackberry watching him intently, waiting for his lead and disregarding Bigwig's. Then he looked at Pipkin, huddled into a fold of sand, more panic-stricken and helpless than any rabbit he had ever seen. At this moment, up in the wood, there broke out an excited yelping and a jay began to scold.<br><br>Hazel spoke through a kind of light-headed trance. "Well, you'd better get on, then," he said, "and anyone else who wants to. Personally, I'm going to wait until Fiver and Pipkin are fit to tackle it."<br><br>"You silly blockhead!" cried Bigwig. "We'll all be finished! We'll-"<br><br>"Don't stamp about," said Hazel, "You may be heard. What do you suggest, then?"<br><br>"Suggest? There's no suggesting to be done. Those who can swim, swim. The others will have to stay here and hope for the best. The dog may not come."<br><br>"I'm afraid that won't do for me. I got Pipkin into this and I'm going to get him out."<br><br>"Well, you didn't get Fiver into it, did you? He got you into it."<br><br>Hazel could not help noticing, with reluctant admiration, that although Bigwig had lost his temper, he was apparently in no hurry on his own account and seemed less frightened than any of them. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></blockquote>
<a class="jsHideSpoiler spoilerAction">(hide spoiler)</a>]</span><br><br><strong>Other key rabbits: </strong> Blackberry, the clever buck; Pipkin, small, loving, loyal;  Dandelion, fastest runner and skilled storyteller;  Silver, Holly, and Buckthorn, brave fighters and good trackers; Speedwell, Acorn, and Hawkbit, foot soldiers. There is also Strawberry, the adopted "honeycomb" construction engineer, and Blackavar, an adopted "Owsla" rabbit, trained for guard duty, battle tactics, and reconnaissance by General Woundwort. One character that didn't seem to fit this story is Bluebell, because he is always telling jokes. Eventually some does join the warren. The does play a small role, entering the story late. <br><br>Another key character is Kehaar, the sea gull with a Germanic accent who becomes friends with Big Wig and Hazel.<br><br>Also, enemy rabbits, including Catspaw, Woundwort, Vervain, etc.<br><br><strong>Quibbles:</strong> The author slows the pace by digressing, stuffing the narrative full of unnecessary monologues about flowers, trees, animals, rivers, etc., showing his own love for nature, I assume (he worked as a civil servant for the Ministry of Agriculture). Here is an example, the longest paragraph in chapter 4, and yet <strong>it does nothing</strong> to advance plot or characterization (<u>not</u> a spoiler): <a class="jsShowSpoiler spoilerAction">(view spoiler)</a><span class="spoilerContainer" style="display: none">[<blockquote>Fu Inl'e means "after moonrise." Rabbits, of course, have no idea of precise time or of punctuality. In this respect they are much the same as primitive people, who often take several days over assembling for some purpose and then several more to get started. Before such people can act together, a kind of telepathic feeling has to flow through them and ripen to the point when they all know that they are ready to begin. Anyone who has seen the martins and swallows in September, assembling on the telephone wires, twittering, making short flights singly and in groups over the open, stubbly fields, returning to form longer and even longer lines above the yellowing verges of the lanes-the hundreds of individual birds merging and blending, in a mounting excitement, into swarms, and these swarms coming loosely and untidily together to create a great, unorganized flock, thick at the center and ragged at the edges, which breaks and re-forms continually like clouds or waves-until that moment when the greater part (but not all) of them know that the time has come: they are off, and have begun once more that great southward flight which many will not survive; anyone seeing this has seen at work the current that flows (among creatures who think of themselves primarily as part of a group and only secondarily, if at all, as individuals) to fuse them together and impel them into action without conscious thought or will: has seen at work the angel which drove the First Crusade into Antioch and drives the lemmings into the sea.</blockquote>

<span id="freeText3736171235377824957" style="display:none"><strong>Una cosa può esser la verità e, insieme, essere una follia senza speranza.</strong><br><br>Credo che prima di parlare dell'opera in sé, occorra fare un piccolo appunto sulla traduzione di Paolini: eccelsa. Per dirla breve, è pura poesia. Essendo un libro ricchissimo di fantasia e di termini inventati, il traduttore deve aver faticato moltissimo per renderlo come l'ha reso, ma c'è da dire che l'ha fatto egregiamente, e per questo bisogna rendergliene merito.<br><br>Watership Down narra di un gruppo sparuto di conigli che, grazie al famoso intuito di uno di essi, scappano in tempo dalla loro conigliera prima che questa venga sterminata da alcuni uomini che vogliono costruirci sopra. Il viaggio appare lunghissimo, ma è in realtà molto breve. Il lettore è subito spinto a ragionare in termini "coniglieschi", e anche la concezione del tempo cambia. Prima di giungere al colle Watership, dove decidono di costruire la loro nuova casa, questo gruppo di conigli incapperà in pericoli più o meno grandi. Attraverso i loro occhi vediamo il mondo da un'altra prospettiva, una prospettiva che con la nostra non ha nulla a che fare, e grazie a questo possiamo imparare a capire un po' di più la natura. Forse anche a rispettarla.<br><br>Inquietante è l'episodio della conigliera "maledetta". Questo posto sembra molto accogliente, ma i conigli in realtà sono apatici. Vivono vicinissimi agli uomini e si cibano alla grande, però ogni tanto qualcuno scompare. Sono troppo abituati a questo metodo di vita, a questo patto uomo-coniglio per cambiare le cose e aprire gli occhi.<br><br>Dopo questo le acque sembrano calmarsi. Finalmente i conigli hanno trovato la loro conigliera. Vengono raggiunti da due sopravvissuti alla strage della loro vecchia casa. Se non che, si accorgono di essere destinati all'estinzione nel caso non provvedano a trovare qualche femmina. Così parte la ricerca, anche grazie a un gabbiano che si fanno amico con l'intelligenza del loro capo, Moscardo. Gli unici conigli nei paraggi sono quelli domestici, chiusi in gabbia, di una fattoria lì vicino. Gli altri appartengono a una grandissima conigliera a due, tre giorni di viaggio. Mentre una spedizione parte per questa conigliera, Moscardo e Nicchio, un altro coniglio, tentano una sortita alla fattoria per vedere se possono fare qualcosa con i conigli domestici. Questi sono quattro, e hanno un po' paura a seguirli. Moscardo promette di ritornare molto presto. <br><br>Mi fermo qui nel raccontare l'episodio perché se no svelo tutta la trama. Tornando alla spedizione per la grande conigliera, che dà poi vita all'episodio fulcro del romanzo, intendo analizzare attentamente la società di quei conigli. A capo di essi c'è il Generale Vulneraria. Semplice Coniglio Capo? No. Trattasi di un tiranno, ed Efrafa, la sua conigliera, non è altro che una dittatura oligarchica. Qui si inserisce il tema sociale del romanzo. E spero di non essermi sbagliato e di non star sparando un mare di stronzate. Questa società conigliesca è retta da Vulneraria e da una specie di aristocrazia militare chiamata Ausla (presente quasi in tutte le conigliere, ma qui con poteri praticamente assoluti). Gli orari dei conigli sono scanditi regolarmente. Nessuno se ne può andare. Chi tenta la fuga viene o ammazzato o torturato. Se arrivano forestieri, vanno arrestati e incorporati nella società. La conigliera è suddivisa in "marche" e per passare da una marca all'altra serve un permesso speciale del comandante in capo a quella in cui si trova. In questo clima soffocante, le femmine risucchiano i cuccioli dentro di loro e non partoriscono. Cresce il malcontento. Ma nemmeno di fronte all'evidenza, il dittatore, il Generale Vulneraria, vuole cedere un pezzo del suo potere. Da tempo ha organizzato Pattuglie a Largo Raggio che tengano sotto controllo tutta la zona. Efrafa è, in breve, uno stato dittatoriale in miniatura, composto da conigli anziché da umani. E, nel suo finale fallimento, possiamo vederci decine di episodi storici e attuali.<br><br>Ultimo fatto rilevante del romanzo è la bontà umana nei bambini, assente invece negli uomini. I conigli reputano l'uomo uno dei nemici principali, eppure sarà una bambina a compiere un atto molto buono, alla fine. <br><br>In questo romanzo, che è poi un'odissea metaforica, dove al posto dei conigli possiamo mettere benisismo gli uomini e al posto degli animali più grandi i mostri omerici, il tema del viaggio e della libertà, di voler avere una casa e un po' di pace, sono elevati a "ricerca della felicità", e possiamo tutti desiderare di essere conigli per godere dell'erbetta fresca e di tutti quei paesaggi - osservati con occhi veramente attenti - che l'autore ci descrive così splendidamente, ricchi di colori ma anche di insidie. E tutti vorremmo vivere in una società i cui lacci siano meno allentati di quelli odierni. In questo libro, respiriamo la libertà.<br/></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></span>

Yet, I do remember the film that sparked my love for movies (Indiana Jones), and the one book that made me a life-long reader. <strong> Watership Down </strong> is that book. Even 15 years later, I remember how I felt when the "unimportant" Hazel lead a group of rabbits to a better and new life. I remember the bravery and sacrifice of the rabbit Bigwig, and how the courage he showed moved something in my otherwise young heart. <strong> Watership Down </strong> was a classic when I first read it, and remains a classic even as I grow older and more cynical in my life. <br>This is a beautiful and moving story of friendship and sacrifice. Intended for young adults, I still feel that its words will resonate with the more "mature" reader. Whenever I go to a bookstore I still see this proudly displayed and from time to time, people stopping, picking it up and remarking on the impression this book left on them years before. A heartfelt classic that still brings with it fresh memories years later. Reading it feels simply like coming home. Highly recommended.</br></span>

From 1933 until 1938 he was educated at Bradfield College. In 1938 he went up to Worcester College, Oxford to read Modern History. On 3 September 1939 Neville Chamberlain announced that the United Kingdom was at war with Germany. In 1940 Adams joined the British Army, in which he served until 1946. He received a class B discharge enabling him to return to Worcester to continue his studies for a further two years (1946-48). He took the degree of Bachelor of Arts in 1948 and of Master of Arts in 1953.[2]<br><br>He was a senior civil servant who worked as an Assistant Secretary for the Department of Agriculture, later part of the Department of the Environment, from 1948 to 1974. Since 1974, following publication of his second novel, Shardik, he has been a full-time author.<br><br>He originally began telling the story of Watership Down to his two daughters, Juliet and Rosamund, and they insisted he publish it as a book. It took two years to write and was rejected by thirteen publishers. When Watership Down was finally published, it sold over a million copies in record time in both the United Kingdom and the United States. Watership Down has become a modern classic and won both the Carnegie Medal and the Guardian Children's Fiction Prize in 1972. To date, Adams' best-known work has sold over 50 million copies world-wide, earning him more than all his other books put together.<br><br>As of 1982, he was President of the RSPCA.<br><br>He also contested the 1983 general election, standing as an Independent Conservative in the Spelthorne constituency on a platform of opposition to fox hunting.<br><br>He now lives, with his wife, Elizabeth, in Whitchurch, Hampshire, Hampshire, within 10 miles (16 km) of his birthplace.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></span>
