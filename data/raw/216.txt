<p>Following the basic plot of the novel, <i>Watership Down</i> follows the lives of a group of rabbits as they leave their endangered warren in search of a safe new home. They travel across the English countryside, braving perilous danger, until they find a hill called <a href="/wiki/Watership_Down,_Hampshire" title="Watership Down, Hampshire">Watership Down</a>, where they begin a new warren. However, they are endangered by another warren, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Efrafa" title="Efrafa">Efrafa</a>, which is led by the authoritarian <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/General_Woundwort" title="General Woundwort">General Woundwort</a>, and they are soon forced to defend their home and lives.</p>
<p>Although the first season concerned themselves mostly with elements taken from the original novel at first, later on in that same series as well as the second and third deviated almost entirely, with many episodes focusing solely on new characters and situations. For instance, in the second episode, "Home on the Down," Hazel realizes that having their own doe, Blackberry, do all the digging for their new burrow, the traditional role of does among rabbits, is unfair as well as counter-productive. Thus, he and Fiver must find a way to convince the other bucks to help her.</p>
<p>In addition, the third season featured a new opening sequence and style of animation, along with the loss of many of the original voice actors. The programme became noticeably darker in tone, adding elements of mysticsm and magic, such as <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Captain_Campion#Efrafa_rabbits" title="Captain Campion">Campion's</a> encounters with the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Black_Rabbit_of_Inle#Mythological_rabbits" title="Black Rabbit of Inle">Black Rabbit of Inle</a>, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Silverweed_(Watership_Down)#Cowslip.27s_warren" title="Silverweed (Watership Down)">Silverweed's</a> psychic powers, though these would be similar to <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Fiver_(Watership_Down)" title="Fiver (Watership Down)">Fiver's</a> own psychic powers and <a href="/wiki/List_of_Watership_Down_characters" title="List of Watership Down characters">Hannah's</a> learning of hedge magic.</p>
<p>Although the series was praised by younger audiences at the time of the series' air, fans of both the novel and the movie gave it mixed reviews due to drastic changes from the novel (like Blackberry changed from a buck to a doe) and its more child-friendly tone as compared to the violence of the movie. The third season changed this for a darker tone.</p>

Although lamed by this injury, he leads the foray to Efrafa and comes up with the final, successful strategy to defeat General Woundwort. Hazel's beautiful mate is Primrose whom he freed from Efrafa.</p>
<p><b>Fiver</b> – Hazel's younger brother. A small runty rabbit whose visions of the destruction of the Sandleford warren lead him to leave, along with his older brother Hazel and several other rabbits. He appears to be more prescient than his novel counterpart, and his visions come in rhymes. He often feels responsible for foreseeing terrible things or blaming himself for their outcome. He and Hazel are very close.</p>
<p><b>Bigwig</b> – Formerly an officer in the Sandleford Owsla, so-called because of the large amount of hair surrounding his face, giving him the appearance of a <a href="/wiki/Lionhead_rabbit" title="Lionhead rabbit">lionhead rabbit</a>. The largest and most powerful of the Sandleford survivors, he is often blunt and impatient for dangerous action and fighting. After nearly getting killed in a snare in episode 3, he realizes that Fiver is right more often than not. He quickly befriends Kehaar and often asks for his help on Hazel's behalf. Hazel often selects him for the most dangerous missions, such as the infiltration of Efrafa. Later, he becomes captain of Watership Down's Owsla and falls for Spartina, a doe from Darkhaven.</p>
<p><b>Blackberry</b> – Blackberry is a doe who is skilled with herbs and is referred to as the digging expert. She is the most intelligent of the rabbits, and often comes up with ingenious ideas.

She is devastated when she thinks Campion is dead, but is rejoined with him when she is taken prisoner in Darkhaven. At the end of the series she and Campion return to Watership Down together.</p>
<p><b>Dandelion</b> - Dandelion is an accomplished storyteller. He is a joker and a wise guy and provides much of the series' comedy relief.

<p><b>Pipkin</b> - A very young and adventurous rabbit eager to prove himself in the eyes of his bigger companions—particularly Hazel and Bigwig. He is the youngest of the Watership Down rabbits and has the gift of making friends with everyone including other animals in the Down area, to the point that when he is in trouble they will immediately join together with the Watership Down rabbits to come to his rescue. Even General Woundwort found he was not immune to Pipkin's charm and refused to kill him, saying that it would be like killing a part of himself. During the last season Pipkin grows up to be a responsible rabbit, even leading the 'Junior Owsla'.</p>
<p><b>Hawkbit</b> – He is a pessimistic, grouchy and sarcastic rabbit who always has a biting comment for every situation, but is a dependable member of the warren whenever help is needed.

He later becomes a good friend of the more cerebral Dandelion and during the last season, he settles down with Clover.</p>
<p><b>Holly</b> – Former captain of the Sandleford Owsla, Holly has only a minor role and is mostly used as a background character, He formed a key part of the Watership Down defenses in the last season.</p>

Primrose is very supportive of Hazel, who becomes her mate and is also a dedicated mother to her three children Snowdrop, Mallow, and Gilia (who were fathered by Hazel). She and Campion also have a strong bond due to her being saved by him multiple times back in Efrafa. In Efrafa she showed a rebellious and stubborn attitude toward Vervain, who bullied and tormented her at every given opportunity. Despite her deep hatred for Vervain, she, Fiver, Holly, and Captain Broom saved his life when he was caught in some wire, although she originally protested the idea of helping the rabbit "that made her life miserable." Later she hates herself for letting him go when she finds out he formed an alliance out of fear with Woundwort. Primrose replaces the character of Hyzenthlay from the novel and film.</p>
<p><b>Strawberry</b> - A orange rabbit who leaves Cowslip's warren after meeting Hazel and Bigwig and joins them in Watership Down. Initially lazy from his time with Cowslip, he later proves to be an accomplished digger and serves in Bigwig's Owsla.</p>

When Primrose, now free from Efrafa, returns to see her old friends Broom informs her that an unspecified illness has wiped out the entire warren but him.

He and Captain Holly also get along with each other.</p>
<p><b>Kehaar</b> – A black-headed gull who is forced by an injured wing to take refuge on Watership Down. He is characterized by his frequent impatience, guttural accent and unusual phrasing.

<p><b>Cowslip</b> - the so-called leader of the warren, there is some doubt as to whether he is insane or totally evil. Hazel, Fiver and Bigwig first encounter him when they accompany Captain Holly to recover an injured Sandleford rabbit left there, only to learn the warren's terrible secret when Bigwig nearly becomes a victim and that the missing rabbit was a victim. He becomes angered by Hazel's warren when they help a group of his rabbits escape from his warren, and even helps Woundwort to get his revenge on them, however, as he himself states, "I'm a plotter, not a fighter" and he uses both sides for his own gain. Later he trades his seer, Silverweed, to Woundwort in exchange for the destruction of his escaped rabbit's warren.</p>
<p><b>Silverweed</b> – he is a seer with mental abilities similar to Fiver, in particular possessing the ability to see into another rabbit's mind by touch. He is traded to Woundwort to help him seek his destiny and was taken away from the Warren of the Shining Wires to Darkhaven, but later ends up on Watership Down and becomes a good friend of the rabbits there, even sacrificing most of his youth to help save the warren from Woundwort.</p>

<p><b>General Woundwort</b> – He serves as the main antagonist of the series. A brutal and tyrannical leader who sees himself as the one doing everything for the best of his warren, Woundwort strives to destroy Hazel and his 'outsiders' because of the hope for free life they represent for his own subjects. He has black, ragged fur and is blind in his left eye. He deeply respects Campion, even after his betrayal by him, and he often punishes and threatens Vervain, but still values him as an adviser and loyal subject despite this. He shows a soft side briefly after Pipkin tells him that his parents were killed by a weasel (a fate that Woundwort himself went through), and for a brief moment before Efrafa's destruction sees himself for what he is and what he has brought Efrafa to. After the destruction of Efrafa, Woundwort becomes obsessed with seeking his destiny of destruction, which leads him to the warren he was born in: Darkhaven. In the end, he is taken by the Black Rabbit of Inlé along with most of the Darkhaven rabbits.</p>
<p><b>Campion</b> – Campion sees that Woundwort's leadership is destroying Efrafa, but is torn between his feelings for the free ways of Watership Down and his loyalty to his chief rabbit. He met Blackberry and it was love at first sight, but he sacrificed himself to save his chief from a cave in. He survived and was taken to Darkhaven, as was Blackberry soon after, and they sealed their love in Darkhaven and escaped to Watership Down. He fought in the last battle against Woundwort. Afterwards, he and Blackberry settled down together.</p>
<p><b>Vervain</b> - is a cowardly and sneaky rabbit, more adept at spying on others and threatening the weaker ones then in actual combat and is (next to Woundwort) the most hated and despised rabbit of the Watership Down story. Despite his shortcomings, Woundwort values him (though he would not show this) for his loyalty to him. Although Campion saved his life on more than one occasion, Vervain hates him with a passion and would like nothing better than to make Woundwort realize Campion is a traitor. Kehaar is particularly not fond of Vervain and calls him an 'ugly bunny'. After Efrafa's destruction, Vervain tries to live on his own but quickly loses hope, until he is saved by Woundwort. Although somewhat shocked by his master's increasing madness, Vervain continues to serve him, though more out of fear than respect, and he secretly longs to lead a different life, even if such thoughts are futile.He is the secondary antagonist.</p>

Silverweed tries to look into Campion's heart, but he cannot because of the Black Rabbit of Inlé's curse. Woundwort feels empathy for the scarred up rabbit and accepts him, despite Vervain's displeasure. Blackberry and Primrose head towards Darkhaven. Hazel leads the others and manages to rescue Primrose, but Blackberry is captured.</p>
<p><b>The Eyes of Silverweed</b> (English-German translated title* <b>An Unfair Due</b>) Silverweed traps Fiver in a twisted dreamworld illusion, allowing him to invade Fiver's mind and see through his eyes to learn the location of Watership Down for his master Woundwort. Fiver manages to fight off Silverweed's hold, but not before Silverweed deduces that Watership Down is "in the high hills, near a lone beech tree." Hazel realizes how dangerous Silverweed is, so he and the others journey to Darkhaven with the intent of kidnapping him. Meanwhile, Campion and Blackberry have the same idea, whilst Granite becomes Woundwort's new second-in-command when he challenges Vervain to single combat. Vervain forfeits rather than face the stronger Granite and then gets it back by cheating. Fiver gets inside Silverweed's head and the mystic decides to go with Hazel to Watership Down. Silverweed happily to be free at last.</p>
<p><b>The Spy</b> (Same in both languages*) Bigwig uses Silverweed's influence to turn Hawkbit and Dandelion's original ideas against them when they attempt to slack off. Spartina is sent by Woundwort to befriend Hazel and the others and act as a spy for him. She fakes injury in order to be taken in by them. However, Silverweed soon learns of her real objective. Spartina tells Granite that if she does not return to Darkhaven by the next full moon, Granite is to kill Blackberry. Blackberry is chased by Granite, but the male gets injured and the doe helps him. Vervain has her punished for showing mercy. Spartina is enraptured with Watership Down, She doesn't know what to do after having seen it with her own two eyes and she fell in love with Bigwig.</p>
<p><b>The Betrayal</b> (English-German translated title* <b>Campion's Betrayal</b>) Spartina soon gets found out by the other Watership Down rabbits and she confesses everything, even admitting putting Blackberry in danger. Silverweed allows Bigwig to see into Spartina's heart, but the male is frightened by her feelings for him and runs off. Granite attempts to help Campion and Blackberry escape out of gratitude. Silverweed sees a vision involving Hannah's future, but refuses to admit it. After finding out of Spartina's betrayal, Woundwort uses her and Blackberry to make Campion confess where Watership Down is and to lead his army into battle there. After Fiver's vision, Hazel knew the time is come to stop the enemy at once.</p>
<p><b>The Beginning of The End</b> (English-German translated title* <b>Hannah's Big Achievement</b>) The Watership Down rabbits prepare for the last battle with Woundwort, once again gathering their animal friends to aid them and setting up traps around the warren. Scree takes Kehaar's place as the sky watch while Blackberry, Spartina and Campion plan their escape from Woundwort.</p>
<p><b>The Magic</b> (English-German translated title* <b>The Last Battle</b>) It's time to end the war once and for all. Both sides collide and there can be only one winner. After the first attack, both sides are injured and weakened, but they must keep fighting. Hazel tells them he'll stay and fight while the others escape to a new warren, but the warren refuses to leave their leader. Bigwig also goes one on one with Woundwort and Hannah plans to use 'the magic' to finally be rid of Woundwort forever, but Silverweed knows that a high price must be made to use it. So he plans to use it, instead of Hannah. Watership Down is saved at last.</p>
<p> •  <b>Series 3 Episode Titles Error</b> Because the only countries in Europe which aired the third TV series were Germany and Greece, the fan site <b>Thank U Stars</b> provided translations of each episode title directly from the German titles. However sites like <a href="/wiki/Play.com" title="Play.com">play.com</a> and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Tv.com" title="Tv.com">tv.com</a> have found and used the German translated titles and the unofficial ones found on the DVD releases or on screen as they appear at the beginning of each episode.</p>

<p>According to the official <i>Watership Down</i> TV series website (which is now closed) Season 2 was supposed to have an episode produced called <b>Dandelion's Big Story</b>, in which he would tell a story to the younger rabbits, with the roles of El-ahrairah, Prince Rainbow, etc. played by the Watership Down rabbits, while Hazel and Bigwig went to Nuthanger Farm on a raid. However, the episode was never produced and was instead replaced by <b>Bigwig's Way</b>. Even so, the episode title and synopsis managed to find its way on to the 14-disc Region 2 DVD set by <a href="/wiki/Entertainment_Rights" title="Entertainment Rights">Entertainment Rights</a> and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Universal_Pictures" title="Universal Pictures">Universal</a>, where it replaced <b>Bigwig's Way</b>. The episode itself was oddly placed, on a disc with the episodes that preceded Season 3.</p>

<p>Although the story was broadly based on that of the novel, with most characters and many incidents retained, there was an increasing divergence as the series went on, and in later episodes especially some storylines and characters were entirely new.</p>
<ul>
<li>El-ahrairah's name was shortened in the series to El-ahrah.</li>
<li>Hyzenthlay was replaced by a character called Primrose, and her connection to Efrafa was replaced by a heritage in a warren called Redstone. Her ability to have visions much like Fiver was also not present</li>
<li>Fiver's power of prescience became more prominent than in the book and film; he goes blank with visions, sometimes telepathic, instead of simply delivering omens, and also speaks mostly in rhyme while in this state (though he speaks normally otherwise).</li>
<li>Kehaar, in direct contrast to the book, severs his gull-like instincts and becomes attached to the Watership rabbits, even pushing aside his own kind at one point.</li>
<li>Some new exclusive series characters were introduced, despite the fact that there were a few characters from the original book which never appeared in the series.</li>
<li>Blackberry was changed from a buck (male) rabbit to a doe (female).</li>
<li>Woundwort's backstory was altered to include a connection to a warren called Darkhaven.</li>
<li>The character Silverweed was given abilities similar to Fiver's and was turned into a main character for the 3rd series, unlike the novel in which he was a minor character.</li>
<li>Blackavar is still alive, in contrast to the film in which he was killed by Woundwort (that is a film invention, as he survived in the book. Also his ears are intact; the book and the film both depict them as having been torn by the Efrafan Owslafa.)</li>
<li>The major character of Hannah the female mouse was added for the series. Although a male mouse does appear in the novel as a minor character, his personality is much meeker than Hannah's and he speaks with an Italian like accent, while Hannah has a British accent like the rabbits.</li>
<li>Captain Vervain is totally different from how he was described in the book as he was given a more sly and cowardly personality.</li>
</ul>
<p>Two warrens that did not appear in the original book were added: Redstone and Darkhaven. The Redstone warren was dug beneath the remnants of an ancient Celtic stone circle by a band of regular rabbits, but was invaded by an Efrafan patrol. The Darkhaven warren was located beside a burning tire yard with a large pit where the rabbits, extremely vicious in nature, would battle for the position of Chief Rabbit.</p>
