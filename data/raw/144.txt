Holden narrates the story of a couple of days in his sixteen-year-old life, just after he's been expelled from prep school, in a slang that sounds edgy even today and keeps this novel on banned book lists. It begins,<br>"If you really want to hear about it, the first thing you'll probably want to know is where I was born and what my lousy childhood was like, and how my parents were occupied and all before they had me, and all that David Copperfield kind of crap, but I don't feel like going into it, if you want to know the truth. In the first place, that stuff bores me, and in the second place, my parents would have about two hemorrhages apiece if I told anything pretty personal about them."<br><br>His constant wry observations about what he encounters, from teachers to phonies (the two of course are not mutually exclusive) capture the essence of the eternal teenage experience of alienation.</br></br></br></span>

I read the book 2 times before truly understanding, and 3 more after that. The novel is a coming of age novel because the author portrays the thoughts of a teenager in depth greatly. Holden (main character) tends to ramble on and worry and not understand how he is feeling, something most teenagers experience. He doesn't understand the world or anyone, and he feels as if they feel that way about him. It is something you have to look deeply at. For example, in one portion he is talking about a girl he used to like and how his good friend disrespected her, and Holden says, "he doesn't care if she keeps her kings in the back row or not." This is making a reference to when him and the girl used to play chess and she'd do that, and Holden remembered years later even though it was such a small thing, but his friend doesn't care about getting to know the little parts of her, he just wanted to have sex. So this book has to offer a lesson, that you are not the only person in the world who has ever felt the strange and confused feelings you may have felt in the past or currently. You are not the only person to care about small or stupid things and feel things you don't understand. Keep in mind that the message may not always be so clear.<a class="jsHide hideAction" href="#">(less)</a></span></span>

FUCK, life is so full of crap.<br><br>there is one good thing in my life though. just read this book Catcher in the Rye. blown away! i don't know how a book written decades ago could say exactly what i would say. it is like the author was reading my thoughts and put it all down in this book. things i didn't even realize i felt were right there on the page! I LOVED IT. i think this is my favorite novel of all time. which is not saying a whole lot because there is a ton of pretentious bullshit out there and i bet mrs. durham will force us to read it all. man i hate that bitch.<br><br><strong>journal entry</strong><br><br>today i am 20 years old. life is great as usual. just enjoyed my wednesday morning wake-and-bake session with j-p, the sun is shining, the san diego weather is beautiful, and tonight i'm off to rob &amp; gregg's to destroy them at bullshit. love that game! gregg says that joelle will be there (yes!) but she'll probably bring that prick pete with her. one of these days i'm going to lose it and kick his ass. "i'm in a band"...fuck you, pete! i will never spin your records.<br><br>all i have on the agenda today is to go to the gym and then off to keracik's american lit class. it is not a bad class, although it is nowhere close to gender studies with halberstam. or davidoff's survey of modern postmodernism last semester. now that was a class! it blew my mind. so many things to think about. the reading in american lit has been okay. but we've been assigned to read Catcher in the Rye and <u>it is terrible</u>. can't believe i ever liked this book. caulfield is a whiny little bitch. the book has no depth. there is literally nothing going on with the narrative, style, theme, characterization, it is just one rote cliché after another. he thinks he is such a rebel-without-a-cause but in reality he is just another tired representation of rootless, stereotypical masculinity and gender essentialism. completely inane and without meaning. i think my essay will use some acker-style postmodernist techniques to show how simplistic this trite "classic" truly is. i'm going to deconstruct the shit out of this novel, baby!<br><br><strong>journal entry</strong><br><br>today i am 25 years old. another gray, drizzly san francisco morning. i wish christopher would wake up, i really need to talk to him after all that shit last night. notes on my pillow, really?? time to grow up dude, i will never "complete you". well actually i'm glad he's still asleep, my throat is too sore to get into it right now with him. plus Food Not Bombs is happening this morning and i have to get the kitchen ready. john is probably hard at work already, typical over-achieving behavior. i bet the wisconsin kids are still crashing on our living room floor. it's time for them to leave! they've seen The Vindictives at every single Epicenter or Gilman show now and it is time for them to hit the road. or learn to take a shower. this apartment is not the world's crashpad!<br><br>i woke up early this morning and thumbed through A Catcher in the Rye. i remember hating this book in college for some reason. probably wasn't po-mo enough for me. or "challenging". feh. what a pretentious idiot i was. this is a beautiful book. it changed my life as a kid, i'm not sure how i would have survived orange county without it. just re-reading parts of it brought back all that old angst about all the fucked-up shit in the world that kids have to deal with. i'm not sure there is another book as insightful or as meaningful. or funny! that part with the clipping-of-the-toenails is hilarious. ackley is such a douche. this book is the foundation of every zine that i have ever loved. a perfect novel. it is so...."human", i guess.<br><br><strong>journal entry</strong><br><br>today i am 30 years old. man my head hurts...so hungover! my birthday party last night was awesome. even got to spend some time on the turntables (thanks kraddy for actually relinquishing a tiny bit of control for once). i must have made out with a half-dozen people. sadly, no real action. i think last night's party will be the last big party i will ever throw. things have got to change. no more partying like the world is about to end, i still have my entire life ahead of me! tomorrow i am going to go into AIG and hand in my notice. i am not an entertainment insurance underwriter, <u>that is not me</u>. fuck them. if erika can get me that job working with homeless kids at Hospitality House, than i am set. although moving from the biggest room in the flat to the water heater closet will be no fun. i'm 30 years old now for chrissakes! still, i've got to do something meaningful with my life. it cannot all be about booze, drugs, hooking up, and paying everyone's rent when they're broke. things have got to change.<br><br>i cracked open A Catcher in the Rye yesterday before the party and read some of my favorite parts. what an inspiration! seriously, that is a classic novel. it is packed with meaning. i'm twice caulfield's age but i still somehow connect with him in a very direct way. my life is going to change and the attitude expressed in that book is at the heart of that change. i love you, holden caulfied. it's not too late for me to learn from you, to find some meaning in life.<br><br><strong>journal entry</strong><br><br>today i am 35 years old. another intense, sad, but deeply fulfilling week has passed. every day something meaningful happens, something so emotional and real. sometimes i find myself just losing it in a fetal position because of the things i've seen. working with people who are drug addicted or who have been abused or who are dying is HEAVY. but it is also beautiful. it's hard to believe i am dealing with all of that and supporting my folks too. thank God i have good friends to talk to about these things. anyway. so now marcy wants to have a kid. i just don't know how i feel about that. this is such a fucked up world, do we really want to bring new life into it? i dunno. it seems....selfish, somehow. she should just quit her job with the d.a.'s office and get back to her roots in the public defender's office instead. does she think that having a child with me will bring more meaning into her life? my life has meaning enough already. and i really am not sure i can handle that responsibility on top of everything else.<br><br>i skimmed A Catcher in the Rye yesterday, after an awkward talk with marcy about having a baby. it was not an inspiring read. caulfield is so full of misplaced angst! i'm not sure i even understand him anymore. why is he so pissed off? he's seen nothing of the world and what the world can actually do to people. i want to like him, i want to re-capture that feeling of affection i had for him, but now his contempt and his anger just seem so meaningless, so naive. he really does not have it so bad. there is so much worse out there. i don't know how i would handle a kid like that. i hate to say it, but i constantly rolled my eyes when reading it. oh the emotional self-absorption of youth! just you wait, caulfield. it sure gets a hell of a lot more complicated once you grow up.<br><br><strong>journal entry</strong><br><br>today i am 40 years old. when did i become a boss? it is like i woke up one day, mysteriously transformed into an old man. am i really a "leader"? what does that even mean? sometimes i feel like i am just faking it all and someone is going to figure it out and blow the whistle on me. last week i made a huge play on the Council, i had all my ducks in a row, and all the votes came in just as i had planned. everyone has their own agenda and the way to get things done is simply to recognize and engage with that disappointing fact. some folks got up and started clapping and then the whole room joined in, even council members who voted against my motion - feh, phonies. the experience was sort of amazing but it also made me feel very odd, almost disconnected from myself. is this who i am now, a public policy figure, a community advocate, a mayoral appointee? ugh, i can't stand the mayor. i don't feel like me. there is accomplishment there, and some satisfaction... but i am missing something, something visceral, something real. sweet Jesus, is this what a mid-life crisis feels like? it is a weird feeling, like i know everything that i need to know about the world, about the people around me, how everything connects, but yet i still feel like i know so little about life. oh, such angst, mark. surely you've outgrown this?<br><br>i've started re-reading A Catcher in the Rye. it's so strange, during different parts, i felt like crying. a wonderful and moving novel. i feel like i really understand holden, like he is my guide, my son, my brother, my friend... myself. i think of him and i know that change in the world and changing myself can still happen. it just has to happen. that's life after all, right?<br/></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></span>

There was one feature where they asked people what book changed their lives, and something like more than half said <em>Catcher in the Rye</em>.  I think there might have been some celebrity comments in there, too.  At any rate, it was a ringing endorsement.<br><br>So you can imagine my disappointment when I hated it.  Not only did I hate Holden, but I hated everything about the novel.  There was nothing I enjoyed.  I did my book report where I confessed my hatred (which led my teacher to confess that she did, too), but I couldn't let it go.  I honestly felt that my loathing of a novel that so many others found "life-changing" indicated some deep and horrible flaw.  I felt like hating <em>Catcher in the Rye</em> was my dirty little secret.<br><br>Time passed, and my self-loathing mellowed.  I began to think that perhaps I'd come at it too young, so after my first year of college, I decided to re-read it, go at it with fresh eyes, and see if my opinion had changed.<br><br>Here's the thing: it hasn't.  I get it.  I get that Holden is supposed to be loathsome.  I get that he is the hypocrite he hates.  I get that almost all teenagers go through the kind of thinking he experiences.  <em>I get it.</em>  I do.  I just don't like it.<br><br>Oh, and I'm not ashamed anymore.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></span>

I was lousy with angst just like good old Holden back then. I really was. Now that I’m a crummy old guy I figured that I wouldn’t like it anymore. That’s the one thing about crummy old guys, they always hate books that kids like. Every time I reread a corny book that I really liked when I was a kid it makes me want to give the writer a buzz and ask what the hell is going on. It’s like they are trying to give you the time in the back of a cab when you don’t feel like getting the time at all. It’s damn depressing, I swear to God it is. If you want to know the truth, you probably couldn’t even talk to a phony writer on the phone. You would just end up talking to his butler or some snobbish person like that and asking if they would give the writer your message. He probably wouldn’t even do it. The thing with guys like that is that they will never give writers your messages. That’s something that annoys the hell out of me. <br><br>Turns out this is still a damn good book. Salinger kid is a great writer. He really is. Maybe I’m still just an angst-ridden sonuvabitch, but this part kills me:<br><br>“All the kids kept trying to grab for the gold ring, and so was old Phoebe, and I was sort of afraid she’d fall off the goddam horse, but I didn’t say anything or do anything. The thing with kids is, if they want to grab for the gold ring, you have to let them do it, and not say anything. If they fall off, they fall off, but it’s bad if you say anything to them.”p.211<br><br>I’ll bet everyone is going to think that I’m just horsin’ around or trying to be all sexy talking like this. The reason for this corny review is because a thousand other people have already written reviews for this book and I’ll bet that they have already said everything that I want to say. It’s pretty depressing. It really is. That’s about all that I’m going to talk about. Now I just hope that no one writes “fuck you” on this review. That’s the thing with some people, they are always sneaking up and writing “fuck you” on your book reviews when you are not looking. They really are.<br><br><br/></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></span>

<span id="freeText14855483479676266009" style="display:none">I read the end of The Catcher in the Rye the other day and found myself wanting to take Holden Caulfield by the collar and shake him really, really hard and shout at him to grow up. I suppose I've understood for some time now that The Catcher in the Rye -- a favorite of mine when I was sixteen -- was a favorite precisely because I was sixteen. At sixteen, I found Holden Caulfield's crisis profoundly moving; I admired his searing indictment of society, his acute understanding of human nature, his extraordinary sensitivity (I mean, come on, he had a nervous breakdown for God's sake, he had to be sensitive). At sixteen, I wanted to marry Holden Caulfield. At forty, I want to spank him. After all, Holden's indictment of society boils down to the "insight" that everybody is a phony. That's the kind of insight a sixteen year old considers deep. A forty year old of the grown-up variety recognizes Holden's insight as superficial and banal, indulging in the cheapest kind of adolescent posturing. It suggests a grasp of society and of human nature that's about as complex as an episode of Dawson's Creek. Holden and his adolescent peers typically behave as though the fate they have suffered (disillusionment and the end of innocence) is unique in human history. He can't see beyond the spectacle of his own disillusionment (and neither can J. D. Salinger); for all his painful self-consciousness, Holden Caulfield is not really self-aware. He can't see that he himself is a phony. <br><br>Compare Salinger's novel of arrested development, for instance, with a real bildungsroman, Great Expectations. Holden Caulfield is an adolescent reflecting on childhood and adolescence; Pip Pirrip is an adult reflecting on childhood and adolescence. Holden Caulfield has the tunnel vision of teendom, and he depicts events with an immediacy and absorption in the experience that blocks out the broader context, the larger view. Pip Pirrip has the wonderful double vision of a sensitive adult recollecting the sensitive child he used to be; he conveys at the same time the child's compelling perspective and the adult's thoughtful revision of events. While Holden Caulfield litters his narrative with indignant exposes of phonies and frauds, Pip Pirrip skillfully concentrates on "the spurious coin of his own make" -- that is, without letting the child Pip and the adolescent Pip in on the joke, he exposes himself as a phony. Pip Pirrip grows up. Holden Caulfield has a nervous breakdown. <br><br>I suppose the only reason I begrudge him his breakdown is that so many in our culture -- many more, unfortunately, than just the legitimate adolescents among us -- seem fixated on Holden as a symbol of honesty and socially-liberating rebellion. We view nervous collapse and dysfunction as a badge of honor, a sign -- to put it in Caulfieldian terms -- that we are discerning enough to see through all the crap. Our celebration of overwrought disaffection reminds me of the last sentence of Joyce’s Araby: “Gazing up into the darkness I saw myself as a creature driven and derided by vanity; and my eyes burned with anguish and anger.” Here is the adolescent pose non-pareil. Equally self-accusing and self-aggrandizing, it captures the adolescent at the precise moment when his own disillusionment becomes the object of his grandiose and self-dramatizing vision. That’s the kind of crap that Holden Caulfield (and J. D. Salinger) cannot see through. And it is often the kind of crap that we “adults” like to slosh around in. <br><br>The Barney beating of several years ago is another symptom of our arrested adolescence, our inability to ride the wave of disillusion into the relatively calm harbor of adulthood -- as though flailing around in the storm and raging at the wind were in themselves marks of distinction and a superior sensibility. I remember a news story about a woman in a Barney costume being seriously injured when a rabid (and probably drunken) anti-Barney fanatic attacked the big purple dinosaur at some public event. Now, I don’t know the age of the Barney-beater, but the act itself is a supremely adolescent one, in which the impulsive response to disillusionment is to lash out at those symbols of childhood which made the biggest dupes of us. At the dawn of adolescence, when Barney begins to appear cloying and false, it seems natural to want to beat up on him, as though it was Barney himself who pulled one over on us instead of our own poignant and necessary misapprehension of the nature of things. I could see Holden Caulfield beating up on Barney (at least rhetorically), and I could see Holden Caulfield missing Barney (as he misses all the “phonies” at the end of the book), but I cannot see Holden Caulfield accepting the postlapsarian Barney on new terms, as a figure who is meant for children and not for him. For all his touching poses about wanting to be the “catcher in the rye,” what Holden really wants is not to save children but to be a child again.</br></br></br></br></br></br></span>

Focusing on the future, limited scope, superficiality, all qualities most 16 year olds contain.<br>Perhaps Salinger was appealing to a younger audience, or perhaps he was wanting people to have the reaction you did. At first loving Holden, then as the reader grows up, learning that Holden is extremely flawed (as most people are at 16), realizing that having the personality of a sixteen year old is a negative thing, that there is more to life than we see when we are 16.<br>I like j.D did a pretty good job of depicting a teenager, and if think he did a pretty good job of eventually having readers look back on Holden (and maybe themselves??) and realizing that he was flawed (and so are we).<br>I don't know, I like the book. I think two stars is pretty harsh because it's still pretty great, I mean that pimp scene is pretty cool. Ya know funny sad.</br></br></br></span>

Admittedly, this is tougher to do with "classics" but it certainly happened in this case.  I remember first reading this in school (like many of us) and not thinking it was anything special. However, having first read it almost 25 years ago, I knew I had to read it again before I could feel justified in actually reviewing it. Of course, I didn’t hold out much hope that my feelings would change and was expecting a fairly painful reading experiece. <br><br>In fact, as I started reading, I was already thinking about what my amazingly insightful, completely “isn’t it cool to bash on the classics” 1 star review was going to focus on. I thought maybe I could bag on the less than spectacular prose used by Salinger (making myself feel really smart in the process). Or maybe I could take some jabs at the less than exciting narrative pacing (and throw in a few references to "watching paint dry"). <br><br>In the end, I thought my most likely avenue for <s>attacking</s> reviewing this anthem of teen angst was that it was <s>utterly yawn inspiring</s>no longer relevant today because of the GLUT of teen angst that the recent generations have been exposed to <u>ad nauseam</u> growing up. I mean we live in a time in which teen angst is EVERYWHERE and even has its own sub-genre label now.

I found myself empathizing with Caulfield almost from the beginning (something I did not expect to do). His "annoying", "pseudo rebellious" and "just don't care" exterior were so obviously manufactured and so patently hiding a seriously sad and lost boy that I was transfixed on finding the real Holden Caulfield. <br><br>Despite the book being written "in Holden's own words" the reader was still able to discern that Holden's surface response to a situation was hiding a much deeper, emotional resposne. For Salinger to be able to infuse that kind of nuance into the sparse prose of Caulfield’s narrative was nothing short of brilliant in my opinion. <br><br>Caulfied is lazy. He is stubborn. He is immature. He is unfocused. He is untruthful. He is dangerously short-sighted and he is lost in his own world or unrealistic expectations. Sounds like that could certainly be a not unsubstantial portion of the male 16 year old population.   <br><br>However, after reading this book, I learned a few other things about Holden that I though were fascinating and that are not as often discussed:<br><br>1.	He is desperately lonely (he even goes so far as ask his cab drivers to join him for a drink);<br>2.	He is generous with his time and his things (he writes an essay for his roommate despite being upset with him and even lets him borrow his jacket); <br>3.	He is extremely sensitive and longs for an emotional (rather than just a physical) commitment (he mentions several times his need to “be in love” in order to be physical and his experience with the prostitute certainly bears this out);<br>4.	He is intelligent (despite being lazy and unfocused, Holden displays great insight and intelligence regarding books he has read and displays at the museum); and  <br>5.	Despite being unable to process it correctly, he is full of compassion and has a deep capacity for love, which he shows most notably for his sister (this was one of the most powerful parts of the story for me as it was Holden’s desire to avoid hurting Phoebe that keeps him from running away at the end of the book). <br><br>Taking all of the good and the bad together, I was left with the feeling that Holden is an adolescent on the cusp of adulthood who is achingly afraid of the loss of his childhood and the responsibility and commitment that he sees as required to make it in the “adult” world. He is compassionate, intelligent and deeply emotional and yet is unable (or unwilling) to focus that energy on those steps that he sees as leading him away from his “happy memories of childhood” and closer to the “scary world of the adult.” <br><br>I think this is superbly shown in Holden's expressed dream of wanting to being the “Catcher in the Rye.” <em><u>Quick side note</u>: I had no idea what the title to the book referred to until I just read the book.</em> Here is a person so afraid of growing up and so averse to giving into the pain and sadness that he sees as the result of becoming an adult that he wants nothing more than to spend his life protecting others from losing the innocence of childhood. Big, crazy, “I want to save the world” dreams are a wonderful part of childhood and it is a shame that such ideas and beliefs are too often destroyed under the barrage of “you really need to grow up” rather than having such dreams transitioned and re-focused into daring the improbable within the world of the possible. <br><br>A great and moving reading experience and one that I give my HIGHEST POSSIBLE RECOMMENDATION!! <br/></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></span>

Salinger helped to pioneer a genre where fiction was deliberately less remarkable than reality. His protagonist says little, does little, and thinks little, and yet Salinger doesn't string Holden up as a satire of deluded self-obsessives, he is rather the epic archetype of the boring, yet self-important depressive.<br><br>I've taken the subway and had prolonged conversations on the street with prostitutes (not concerning business matters), and I can attest that Salinger's depiction is often accurate to what it feels like to go through an average, unremarkable day. However, reading about an average day is no more interesting than living one.<br><br>Beyond that, Salinger doesn't have the imagination to paint people as strangely as they really are. Chekhov's 'normal' little people seem more real and alive than Salinger's because Chekhov injects a little oddness, a little madness into each one. Real people are almost never quite as boring as modernist depictions, because everyone has at least some ability to surprise you.<br><br>Salinger's world is desaturated. Emotions and moments seep into one another, indistinct as the memories of a drunken party. Little importance is granted to events or thoughts, but simply pass by, each duly tallied by an author in the role of court reporter.<br><br>What is interesting about this book is not that it is realistically bland, but that it is artificially bland. Yet, as ridiculous a concept as that is, it still takes itself entirely in earnest, never acknowledging the humor of its own blase hyperbole.<br><br>This allows the book to draw legions of fans from all of the ridiculously dull people who take themselves as seriously as Holden takes himself. They read it not as a parody of bland egotism but a celebration, poised to inspire all the bland egotists who have resulted from the New Egalitarianism in Art, Poetry, Music, and Academia.<br><br>Those same folks who treat rationality and intellectual fervor like a fashion to be followed, imagining that the only thing required to be brilliant is to mimic the appearance and mannerisms of the brilliant; as if black berets were the cause of poetic inspiration and not merely a symptom.<br><br>One benefit of this is that one can generally sniff out pompous faux intellectuals by the sign that they hold up Holden as a sort of messianic figure. Anyone who marks out Holden as a role-model is either a deluded teen with an inflated sense of entitlement, or is trying to relive the days when they were.<br><br>But what is more interesting is that those who idolize Holden tend to be those who most misunderstand him. Upon close inspection, he's <a href="http://www.cracked.com/article_19336_6-beloved-characters-that-had-undiagnosed-mental-illnesses_p2.html" rel="nofollow">not depressive</a>, not consumed with ennui or an existential crisis, he's actually suffering from 'Shell Shock'--now known as 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder'.<br><br>The way he thinks about his brother's and classmate's deaths--going over the details again and again in his mind, but with no emotional connection--it's not symptomatic of depression, but of psychological trauma. He is stuck in a cycle, unable to process events, going over them again and again, but never able to return to normalcy.<br><br>It takes a certain kind of self-centered prick to look at someone's inability to cope with the reality of death and think "Hey, that's just like my mild depression over how my parents won't buy me a newer ipod!" It's not an unusual stance in American literature--there's an arrogant detachment in American thought which has become less and less pertinent as the world grows and changes. As recently as <a href="http://www.goodreads.com/review/show/19226230">The Road</a> we have American authors comparing a difficult father-son relationship to the pain and turmoil of an African civil war survivor--and winning awards for displaying their insensitive arrogance.<br><br>Perhaps it's time we woke up and realized that the well-fed despondence of the white man should not be equated with a lifetime of death, starvation, war, and traumas both physical and emotional. And as for Salinger--a real sufferer of Post-Traumatic Stress who was one of the first soldiers to see a concentration camp, who described how you can never forget the smell of burning flesh--I can only imagine how he felt when people read his story of a man, crippled by the thought of death, and thought to themselves "Yes, that's just what it's like to be a trustafarian with uncool parents". No wonder he became a recluse and stopped publishing.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></span>

<span id="freeText9244322102266400038" style="display:none">J.D. Salinger’s ‘Catcher in the Rye’ was published on July 16, 1951. It was his first novel. It became very popular among young adolescents yet not so popular with older generations. I personally thoroughly enjoyed every part of this book. I felt very close to Holden Caulfield, the main character in the story, as I read it. <br>Holden Caulfield, a sixteen year old boy from New York, was quite unlike kids his age. He had no interest in being popular or social. From the very beginning he lets us into part of his personal life. His parents are very touchy and his mother is especially protective. It becomes clear very quickly where Holden’s interests lie and where they start to veer off. He tends to lean away from the fake in the world and is a teller of what is real. <br>Holden is not a fan of the movies at all. He saw his brother, D.B., throw away his natural writing talent all for a large Hollywood check. Any other boy Holden’s age would have been absolutely ecstatic to have a sibling working amongst the stats in Hollywood, but not Holden. It was all far too “phony” for him; and phony is his worst enemy. <br>Salinger’s use of sarcasm and irony is beautiful and hilarious. As I read through each chapter I found myself highlighting funny, sarcastic things Holden would say or think (and trust me, there are DOZENS of time where this occurs.) One specific time in Chapter 8 he is talking to a cab driver who is acting like a real fool. Holden says to the readers, “He certainly was good company. Terrific personality.” <br>Salinger’s character Holden is actually a lot like Salinger in his real life. Like Holden, Salinger was known for his reclusive nature. Uninterested with the fakeness of the world, Holden keeps his distance from phony people. After Salinger’s success of ‘The Catcher in the Rye’, he slowed down his publishing and slowly but surely drifted out of the public eye. To this day Salinger refuses any offers to have ‘The Catcher’ put on the big Hollywood screen. Salinger’s ex lover, Joyce Maynard, even once said that, “The only person who might ever have played Holden Caulfield would have been J.D. Salinger.” It seems to me that it is no coincidence that Holden is no fan of Hollywood and that Salinger in real life and doesn’t want anything to do with turning his popular novel into a movie. Holden says, “If there’s one thing I hate, it’s the movies, Don’t even mention them to me.”<br>Since I have learned more about Salinger’s personal life, I recognize a lot of Salinger’s personality in Holden. In the story, Holden has overbearing parents much like Salinger’s parents. Salinger said his mother was over protective. Salinger has one sibling, a sister, which is ironic because it is Holden’s sister Phoebe who has a profound influence on Holden. He often talks about her with very high regards.<br>Holden is not a character who tried to sugarcoat the way he sees the fakeness around him. Holden, making fun of the people around him, often says things like “you would’ve puked” and “it was very phony”.  I think that is another one of the reasons I like his character so much. For example, he is quite upset with the fact that his brother D.B. is selling his work to Hollywood instead of using his talents for his own pleasure. Holden even says that his brother is his favorite author. Salinger himself is a man who wrote for his own pleasure and likeness. <br>I made a similar connection to a girl named Sally that Holden likes in the book, to a real life lover of Salinger’s named Oona. Oona O’Neil was self-absorbed and stuck up, according to Salinger, yet he still phoned and wrote her letters quite often. Holden’s “Oona” in the story was a girl named Sally Hayes. Though he found her extremely irritating he thought she was very attractive as well. After spending a day with her, he pointed out about a dozen instances where he thought she was being “phone as hell”. By the end of their only meeting in the book, Holden says to Sally, “You give me a royal pain in the ass if you want to know the truth.” The real life Oona O’Neil ended up breaking it off with Salinger and married the famous actor, Charlie Chaplin.<br>Despite Holden being a sixteen year old teenage boy he acts much older than his age. One time in the story he has the chance to be with a prostitute but instead of acting like a pig, he starts to feel sorry for her and instead tried to have a conversation with her. He even offers to pay her for good conversation instead of for sex. He also stays alone in hotels randomly, drinks at bars and clubs often, and even tells people he’s older than he really is. But the reason I find his character mature and intellectual is for other reasons.<br>Holden does not hold money or material things to be really important. He is more excited to hang out with his kid sister than he is any other time in the entire book. He is content with something that would probably be boring to other guys his age.<br>Like many teenagers, Holden is often depressed. The way he deals with it most times actually breaks my heart in a way. He likes to talk to his deceased kid brother, Allie. He will take a real event that he can remember where he was talking with him and pretend he is talking to him again. He says, “I started talking out loud to Allie. I do that sometimes when I get very depressed.” It is really very heart wrenching to hear Holden talk about his brother. One of my favorite moments in the book is when Holden and Phoebe are talking in Phoebe’s room and she points out that Holden doesn’t like anything. Holden responds quickly by saying, “I like Allie. And I like doing what I’m doing right now. Sitting here with you and talking and thinking about stuff…”  Phoebe says to Holden, “Allie’s dead-you always say that! If somebody’s dead and everything, and in heaven then it isn’t really--”. Holden interrupts her with his final comeback, “I know he’s dead! Don’t you think I know that? I can still like him, though, can’t I? just because somebody’s dead, you don’t just stop liking them, for God’s sake- especially if they were about a thousand times nicer than the people you know that’re alive and all.”<br>One of the most beautiful things about ‘The Catcher in the Rye’ is the way Salinger uses symbolism. From Holden’s red hunting hat, to Jane Gallagher’s checker playing technique, Salinger wrapped up more than meets the eye into things you never would have dreamed. The main thing that drew me into this story is the realness of Holden’s character. He is a teenage boy with a teenage boy’s mind but seems to have far more common sense than anyone else around him. He is not a jock. He is not a math whiz or a science whiz. He is not really interested in sports. He sort of makes up his own category; a category that I call ‘the genuine’. He is on his own a lot and loves it at first, but happiness and love are meant to be shared with others. It has a much less meaning when by itself and he realizes it by the end of the novel. He is growing intellectually little by little throughout the whole book. He realizes what really makes him happy.  I would absolutely recommend this book to anyone and everyone who would like to read a story that could possibly change the way they view the world. I have honestly laughed outloud to myself as I read this story. Yes, there is talk about drinking, sex, and lots of cussing, but if you are going to avoid reading this story because of that then  your missing out on a beautiful masterpiece. <br/></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></span>

Holden (which is the name of a car) is just a vehicle to "understand" the WW2. See my review. When you understand that Salinger couldn't say what he knew about this war so he wrote it as a children's book... Just like Felix Salten in Bambi (not the Disney version, which is probably why Salinger didn't get his published.<br><br>Salinger tells you this is nit a David Copperfield story.  So don't read it like it is about Holden.  Hint: look at the first page of David Copperfield to understand "Caiulfields" name.<br><br>I hope you will reread it again.  This time when you get to the Merry go round play the music Salinger said was playing, and see if that makes sense or if he is using this book to tell you about money, power and war.</br></br></br></br></span>

And the only feelings he can grasp are loneliness and misery. Almost every answer to any question on my study guide always has something to do with Holden wanting to talk to someone, or "discovering himself" or the fact that everyone is a freaking phony. I honestly do not care what kind of a life he dealt with. It's not fair to treat everyone like shit just because you had a bad life. <br><br>I read some of the comments regarding how I didn't understand this book because I didn't relate to it. That may be true. Regardless, I still think to this day that this book is a drag and has an unlikable main character and dry writing style. Perhaps I will read it again when I am older and may enjoy it. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></img></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></span>

<span id="freeText12754118688583538310" style="display:none">As a child, we are protected from life. There really aren’t many choices available, and we are certainly sheltered from a lot of the harder parts of life. It seems like children don’t feel the need for meaning quite like adults do- maybe because they aren’t forced to face the daily grind. There’s boredom, but that is not what I am talking about. Kids don’t really have to compromise like adults do. As you enter adulthood you could start to see things and people as phony or fake. Maybe not people, but certain tasks or events certainly are. There’s a constant struggle in all of us between the meaningful and the mundane; the temporary and the eternal. There is a conflict, simply of time and energy. We desire the intentional and struggle towards spirituality; all while trying to earn a paycheck, wash our dishes, and sleep each night. It kind of reminds me of what I picture an AA meeting to look like. I think, rarely could someone find a place where people are more vulnerable, open, and honest with each other. Even if they win over addiction… how could life ever feel as full after that brief moment shared with others who completely understand? At the same time, the point of those meetings is to help people live- not just free from drugs, but maybe free to live in the mundane? Free to enjoy the dance of life, the needs of the soul balanced with the chores too. This doesn’t have to be depressing, but it does require compromise- or a sense of a time and place for everything- including the day-to-day.<br><br><br>Catcher in the rye touches on some of these questions. Holden struggles with growing up. He sees everything as meaningless and adults as predictable and fake. I think he is mourning the loss of his innocence… maybe not just right from wrong, but the loss of dreams growing up seems to require. Holden, while at the museum that is exactly the same as it was when he was a kid says he likes it, because each time you visit "the only thing that would be different would be you…" and goes on to say "certain things they should stay the way they are. You ought to be able to stick them in one of those big glass cases and just leave them alone. I know that's impossible, but it’s too bad anyway." One thing I thought of to help explain Holden's struggle with growing up is this: Coffee. When I was a kid, I used to smell my dad's coffee- that strong sugary-sweet smell of roasted beans. You wait for your chance to be let in on this excellent secret. Thinking it is just the caffeine that is preventing your parents from giving you a taste. Finally, they do and then all your dreams of that sweet flavor come crashing down! It's wrecked! Coffee isn't at all what you thought it was! That is, until the day you give it another chance, you start to be able to smell and taste the different tones coffee has. You can appreciate it for its varied, and almost living flavors. You see… Coffee isn't bad- it just wasn't what you always thought. The key is in finding the hidden flavors and getting over the fact that it will never taste as sweet as it smells. I think Holden struggled with the initial shock, that although life is more bitter than it "smells", or than you think it will be, there are the hidden joys and sweet flavors that make it almost better!<br><br>This book doesn’t really set out to answer any of the questions it raises. Holden experiences the extremes of entering into adulthood and relates it in a way everyone, maybe especially, teenagers can understand. He is a flawed character who is desperate and depressed. As the reader, you can see why he feels the way he does, as he explains it so well you almost feel it with him. However, you can also see the flaws in his thinking. The author doesn't romanticize Holden's life, you don't read it thinking he has some special key to life that we all need. You simply feel his struggle to fit in and hope eventually he can learn to play the game and see the beauty that is there, hidden a little.</br></br></br></br></br></span>

Holden (which is the name of a car) is just a vehicle to "understand" the WW2. See my review. When you understand that Salinger couldn't say what he knew about this war so he wrote it as a children's book... Just like Felix Salten in Bambi (not the Disney version, which is probably why Salinger didn't get his published.<br><br>Salinger tells you this is nit a David Copperfield story.  So don't read it like it is about Holden.  Hint: look at the first page of David Copperfield to understand "Caiulfields" name.<br><br>I hope you will reread it again.  This time when you get to the Merry go round play the music Salinger said was playing, and see if that makes sense or if he is using this book to tell you about money, power and war.</br></br></br></br></span>

<span id="freeText3770322341017874390" style="display:none">Okay. So it's like this. My not-just-GR-friend-but-very-real-friend brian called and told me that J.D. Salinger had died maybe about a half hour ago (as I begin this 'review'). This sounds immensely absurd, pathetically sentimental, and embarrassing to admit, but I'm glad I heard it from him and not from some animatronic talking head with chin implants and immobile hair on the nightly news or from an obnoxiously matter-of-fact internet blurb, commenting like a machine on how Holden Caulfield has lately become less relevant to Generation Y or Z or AA or whatever stupid generation we're up to now. <br><br>At first when brian told me, I thought, 'Oh, well... He was old. He was (probably) batshit crazy anyway. It was his time to check out, I guess.' Really. What difference does it make? He's been dead to the world since the mid-1960s. Before I was even born. A strong case could be made that he truly died in spirit when he started stalking Elaine Joyce on the set of 1980s sitcom <em>Mr. Merlin</em>. And yet... I still clung to this (still technically living) legend as if he were some kind of talisman I could wear around my neck, a good luck charm to ward off phonies and all manner of soulless dreck who populate this despicable world, writing 'fuck' on grammar school walls (and metaphorical equivalents). <br><br>After returning for a few minutes to my soul-deadening job, which -- when you really get right down to it -- is just another way of killing time until I join Salinger in oblivion, I started getting all funny-feeling about it. At the risk of sounding like an adult contemporary power ballad written by Jim Steinman, with synthesized violins in the background, I began to feel as if my adolescence had finally come to an end. I guess it's about time. I'm thirty-eight years old, and yet I look at the people who are my age -- hell, who are even <em>much younger</em> than I am -- and who appear in all particulars to be adults, and I grow frightened/alarmed that they've graduated to the 'next level': they're mating and spawning and drawing up wills and completing their own tax returns and investing money and dealing (gracefully -- or with stoicism?) with the deaths of friends and relatives... and even some of them have died themselves of terrible diseases -- the kinds of diseases which are not content with merely claiming lives but which demand the optimal human suffering (the optimal dehumanization) before they cash in. <br><br>So of course. I love all of Salinger's writing, but his value in my life has far surpassed that of a 'mere' literary pastime. He has kept me company for many years when I felt left behind by the exigencies of time and the claims of 'maturity.' In my head, I still picture myself as a nineteen-year-old, and I'm shocked again and again when somehow every other moron on the planet seems to be under the ridiculous impression that I'm a thirty-eight-year-old man. With graying hair. And deepening crow's feet. What idiots!<br><br>I know all of this shit I'm saying is cliché, cliché, cliché. Lots and lots of people feel a special connection to Salinger's writing -- for just the reasons I described -- and lots and lots of people hate his writing because they find it grating and immature (<em>Catcher in the Rye</em>) or pretentious and ponderous (the Glass family stories). But I felt compelled to commemorate today in some way -- however trite and superfluous -- because I sense again and again (with the relatively recent deaths of some of my heroes, like Ingmar Bergman and Jacques Derrida, for instance) that I am entering a world that is no longer safeguarded by the great men and women of the elder generation; I am entering a world in which I am now the elder... with my own responsibilities and obligations. Yes, this still frightens me, but I'll always have Salinger's very particular and empathetic world to which to retreat when I have sacrificed too much of myself to a real world I'll never completely understand or feel at home in.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></span>

<span id="freeText861729348193907479" style="display:none">**Included on Time’s List of 100 Best Fiction of the 20th Century**<br><br>If you really want to hear about it, the first thing you’ll probably want to know is what I thought about “The Catcher In the Rye”, and my reasons for liking it or disliking it, and possibly even how I felt about the work each of the four times I’ve wasted my time reading it, and all that 'Mein Kampf' kind of crap, but I don’t feel like going into it, if you want to know the truth.  Also, I’d probably have to take the time to learn how to italicize things on GoodReads, which would probably be worthwhile, but my computer skills could easily be outshone by a resuscitated troglodyte fresh from an ice-block.   Added to that, I don’t know how long I could go on trying to poorly mimic the book without wanting to puke, I mean, not only is it a crumby thing to do to, but it’s also phony as hell.<br><br>	So what do I think about the madman exploits of old Holden Caufield, perhaps one of the most acclaimed protagonists in all of American literature?  No terribly much, as a matter of fact: each time I’ve read this book I wanted to kill myself.  Holden’s always saying things like that, I mean, if you were to wear one blue sock and one red sock, and maybe slowly skin your shrivelfig under the comforting cotton of a green sock, he’d say something like, “God how I hate how that guy messes around with his socks, it makes me want to kill myself.”  In that case, you’d better hope you’re at least in possession of a decent valise, lest that bastard Caulfield spread some more wrath upon you for your clearly inferior luggage.  That guy, he really cracks me up.<br><br>	I never really understood why this book is so universally adored; sure, Holden is a slacker, the type of clown that every distraught kid envisions themselves to be, some gem in the rough with all the talent, but lacking the ambition to make a notable mark on the world which holds them back.  But you grow up, if only to acknowledge you have no talents and still have no ambition, and instead of grabbing for that golden ring, you waste your time writing shitty reviews on shitty books here on goodreads on a ball-dampeningly warm Sunday afternoon.  Come to think of it, that’s probably why so many appreciate this bumbling tale; like Holden, they probably equate themselves to that misshapen hunk of precious metal hidden beneath a untilled mound of Nebraskan soil, laying in wait for someone to unearth their sparkling brilliance for all the world to admire.  Of course, when you realize Tucker Max probably felt the same way you immediately bathe in bromine and shave what remains of your flesh completely bald to scour the scourge as thoroughly as humanly possible. Perhaps it may be slightly more promising to delude yourself than resigning your life to the contemplation of just how lame you actually are.<br><br>	So here’s a quick glimpse of what’s inspired so many lifelong laughingstocks.  Here’s Holden fruitlessly swimming against the current, a complete nincompoop (let’s remember he’s Irish) who gets kicked out of school for being a moron and talks hard yet winds up getting the shit mercilessly beaten out of him by a crumby snob named Stradlater (a book about Studly Strad would have been far better) and a pimp named Maurice.  Holden also feels the need to denounce everyone as a phony, though I find myself at a loss to imagine anything phonier than a wimpy, big-mouthed mick mollycoddled by daddy’s fat bankroll while attending prep school along with his stunning array of hand-crafted, Italian leather luggage.  Let’s not gloss over the fact that Holden is probably impotent, as evidenced by his inability to lay the wood to Sally, Jane, or even a prostitute, perhaps his crowning disgrace.  Either that or he’s queer, seeing as he duped poor Antolini by presenting his former mentor with the ultimate fantasy of a drunken, sexually-inexperienced youth with ‘no place to go’ and then, afraid that further action might expose his impotence, he felt the need to flee into the night, acting all startled about what just transpired.  Let’s face it, Holden himself claims that similar ‘perverty’ stuff happened to him a lot as a kid, and then feigns shock when Antolini comes in to take a juicy bite of the bare bottom he so masterfully baited.  All this weirdness coming from an awkward geek with a fondness for children ought to be enough to sway any who remain unconvinced thus far.  You’re STILL not seeing the light?!?  Seriously?  Ok, last clue Caulfield is a deviant: the kid aspires to be a “catcher”.  And this ‘catcher’ fantasy involves children.  If you need further explanation I’ll be required to rent a jackhammer to pound the obvious into your skull.<br><br>	This will hopefully be the last time that I read “The Catcher in the Rye”, as I’ve given it too many chances and always walked away completely disappointed.  I will give Salinger's opus two stars, however, simply for the entertainment of laughing at it.<br/></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></span>

Ok so I don't really know where I'm going with this comment, only I think you may want to go punch your pillow or take deep breaths as your anger for this book is a little much. Yeah, I liked it, but I'm a teenager. Also it speaks to its longitevity that I can really understand him even though he was created in the 40s.</span>

Holden Caulfield's problem is that he is the biggest phony he knows.  Count the number of times he lies or behaves like someone he's not and then try to convince me otherwise.  This is not a book about teenage alienation.  It's about a smart-ass who can't deal with who he really is and spends almost 300 pages ranting about it - most likely to a doctor in a psych ward.   </span>

<span id="freeText11397297092014145293" style="display:none">I think Holden is supposed to be a phony. I think that's kind of the point, that's he's so oblivious to his own problems because he's focused on everyone else. In a way Holden's phoniness is part of his obsession with innocence and Allie's death. Holden gets so upset over Jane going out with Stradlater, and the real reason he wouldn't sleep with the prostitute, and why the grafitti in the museum makes him so mad, and a hundred other little things in the book. Holden wants to protect the innocence of everyone around him, and he's mad at people who have already lost theirs, and he's mad at people who try to take it from others. But Holden himself is no longer innocent, and if he's honest with himself then that means he has to deal with the fact that he doesn't live up to his own standards. However, if Holden has to worry about fixing himself, he can't devote his time to protecting Pheobe and the others, so it's easier for Holden to deny his own problems and worry about everyone else. Holden's realization at the end with the carousel and allowing Pheobe to try to grab the ring is important not just because it symbolizes Holden letting go of Allie, or realizing that he can't protect Pheobe forever, but also because if opens the door for Holden to focus on himself.</span>

<em>"Oh, I don’t know. That digression business got on my nerves. I don’t know. The trouble with me is, I like it when somebody digresses. It’s more interesting and all.”</em>
</blockquote>Yes, this review eventually will be about the book. My reviews always are. I'm boring this way. I envy the ability of my friends to digress in their review space and tell me a story which in some way was inspired by something in the book they just read, or its blurb, or - god forbid now, in the land of GR censorship of anything that does not look like a book report - <strong>author behavior, the new scary censorship-causing phrase out there, together with the now-used 'OFF TOPIC' excuse</strong>. <blockquote>Because - oh the horror! - they dare to focus on the readers' opinion rather than the coveted by conglomerates endorsements of THE PRODUCT.<strong> Because for some of us literature does not equal product. Because for some of us, literature is what is designed to make us think and speak up, and not mindlessly consume (consumer instead of reader - that's making me shudder).</strong>
</blockquote>But first I WILL digress (and it seems I already have). And Holden Caulfield, the conflicted rebel with all the makings of a phony of the kind he detests, would probably approve. <strong>And if Holden approves, who the hell cares if Goodreads or Amazon do?</strong> <blockquote>
<em>“It’s this course where each boy in class has to get up in class and make a speech. You know. Spontaneous and all. And if the boy digresses at all, you’re supposed to yell ‘Digression!’ at him as fast as you can. It just about drove me crazy. I got an F in it.”<br>“Why?”<br>“Oh, I don’t know. That digression business got on my nerves. I don’t know. The trouble with me is, I like it when somebody digresses. It’s more interesting and all.”</br></br></em>
</blockquote>..............<img class="escapedImg" src="https://p.gr-assets.com/540x540/fit/hostedimages/1381617212/5103321.jpg" width="300">............<br><br>You can't really love <em>The Catcher in the Rye</em> if you are feeling happy and content. At least I can't. When I'm happy, all I see is a moody overly judgmental privileged teenager looking for reasons to bitch about the world and being immature and a phony. I have to feel some discontent to appreciate the hiding behind that facade helpless anger, pain, loss and a rebellious streak. <strong>Holden is - or at least sometimes unsuccessfully trying to be - a rebel. A troublemaker. A square peg in a round hole. </strong><em>(Yes, I am very aware I'm quoting the Apple commercial. So sue me. Maybe it's off-topic or something. You decide.)</em><br><br>And right now I am not happy and content seeing the site I used to love heading down the road that is perilous at best. The road that clearly shows preference towards consumers over readers. <strong>The consumerism mantra of buy-buy-buy is taking precedence over think-disagree-discuss-passionately argue-watch the truth being born. Holden Caulfield would not approve of such change in direction.</strong> And neither do I or so many people I have come to respect, people whose opinions help me discover the works of literature that I love.<blockquote>Holden Caulfield's views and his expression of them were, admittedly, often juvenile, poorly thought-through and frequently just as phony as those of people he reviles. He was quick to jump to judgment, ignoring those who really cared for him. He was prejudiced, snobbish and arrogant, and a habitual liar, too. How often do the readers want to reach into the book and shake some sense into this boy spiraling down into desperation and a breakdown?<br><br>And yet there is something about the unhappy rebellious teenager that still resonates with us despite the obvious flaws. It is his anger itself, the rage against the world that is fake and all about appearances, about the power imbalance, about the smugness the powerful of this world carry with them. His emotions are so raw and so sincere that I may disagree with some of them but I sure as hell can't ignore them.</br></br></blockquote>As we probably all know too well, <em>The Catcher in the Rye</em> has been one of the most challenged books of the 20th century, riling up the emotions and protests of the wannabe censors who thought it was their sacred duty to shield and protect the public from the work of literature that dared to offend their tender sensibilities. <strong>These self-appointed sensors were (quite ironically, if you think about it) trying to be nothing less than the self-appointed Catchers in the Rye, protecting our childlike innocence from falling prey to <em>The Catcher in the Rye</em>. </strong>What they fail to grasp is that the point of the book itself is that such seemingly noble efforts are useless, worthless, and quite phony in their presumptuousness of knowing what's best; that these efforts are a slippery slope that is futile and dangerous.<br><blockquote>Just as it is equally presumptuous and patronizing and dangerous for any power to tell book readers there is a proper way to express their opinions, that they need to stay ON TOPIC <em>(or else there will be a delete-button action equal to the shriek of 'Digression!' gleefully coming from Holden's classmates). </em><br><br><strong>Playing self-appointed Catcher in the Rye to the delicate sensibilities of certain bookselling sites, entitled writers or a bunch of offended fans, shifting the focus from discussing literature to reviewing product and collecting data - all this is just as misguided as Holden's futile efforts of saving children from growing up.</strong>
</br></br></blockquote><br>You see, this is what I love about Salinger's so often contested work - its ability to stir thoughts and opinions that go beyond the plot and the book report and make you think, and maybe -just maybe - be a touch rebellious, too. This is dangerous, in the best meaning of this word, the meaning that makes all the self-appointed censors uneasy. <strong>These censors would rather have everyone toe the line and do what's expected and never have to face anything that even remotely upsets delicate sensibilities. </strong><br><br><strong>But Holden Caulfield goes on being subversive. And occasionally being off topic - and that's perfectly fine by me. </strong><blockquote>
<em>"Oh, I don’t know. That digression business got on my nerves. I don’t know. The trouble with me is, I like it when somebody digresses. It’s more interesting and all.”</em>

<span id="freeText11688552702080658298" style="display:none">Beautiful!<br><br>I had been somewhat hesitant to read "The Catcher in the Rye" after snoozing through Salinger's "Nine Stories," but I'm glad I finally came around.  This book is a work of genius.<br><br>The book is a "coming of age" tale, but it certainly transcends the adolescent garbage that fills up most of the genre.  The protagonist is 16 year old Holden Caulfield - depressed, aimless, and disillusioned.  The entire story covers just one December weekend in which he seeks to find direction in his life after flunking out of another prep school.  As Caulfield contemplates his transition from adolescence to adulthood, he becomes disgusted with the utter "phoniness" of society and longs for the innocence of youth.<br><br>Where Salinger's masterpieces surpasses other notable coming of age novels such as "Portrait of an Artist as a Young Man" and "This Side of Paradise" is in the treatment of social mores.  Where these other novels offer a one-dimensional treatment of sexuality and religious apostasy as the sum-all of maturation, Salinger offers a more complicated, more realistic picture.  <br><br>Caulfield's narrative certainly deals with sexuality, but he goes beyond the stock material of young man bucking sexual conventions.  After first boasting about past sexual encounters, Caulfield admits he's actually a virgin.  At an age in which sexual experience is a badge of honor for most young men, Caulfied decides that sex should be as much spiritual as physical and ought to be shared only with someone he really cares about.  When his sexually experienced roommate goes out with an innocent childhood friend, Caulfield throws it down with the young man in protest against the perceived assault on innocence.  Later, Caulfield accepts a prostitute into his room only to become depressed, pay the girl, and turn her out without accepting her services.  The following day, Caulfield donates $10 to two humble nuns, the same amount paid to the whore the night before.<br><br>Salinger's treatment of religion is equally nuanced and equally honest.  While claiming to be "practically an atheist," Caulfield also admits that he has a desire to pray.  While disclaiming a belief in God, he occasionally asks what Christ would think about people's actions.  In Caulfield's conflict, the reader sees a certain disgust with the phoniness of organized religion set against a sincere acceptance of Christ's actual message.<br><br>So while this book shares with other novels a contempt for societal mores, it is not a simple repudiation of religion in favor of unrestrained sexuality.  Caulfield does reject most of the adult world he encounters as utterly "phony," but he does not follow the stock pattern laid down by earlier modernists.  Caulfield questions it all, perhaps despising Hollywood above everything else.<br><br>So what does Caulfield accept after rejecting all of adult society?  Childhood innocence.  The only thing that makes this young man happy is spending time with children, his young sister most of all.  Indeed, the section giving rise to the title of the work is a poignant plea for saving innocent children from the phoniness and corruption of the world.<br><br>So for all the past scandal about the profanity and sexuality in this work, there is much to be admired by the secularist and the Christian alike.  That's difficult to do, but Salinger pulls it off marvelously.  Though we can't all agree what influences in society are corrupting, I think most everyone can agree that there is initially some purity that is corrupted.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></span>

<span id="freeText7116219932337234393" style="display:none">(Reprinted from the Chicago Center for Literature and Photography [cclapcenter.com]. I am the original author of this essay, as well as the owner of CCLaP; it is not being reprinted here illegally.)<br><br><strong>The CCLaP 100:</strong> In which I read a hundred so-called "classics" for the first time, then write reports on whether they deserve the label<br>Review #10: <em>The Catcher in the Rye</em>, by JD Salinger (1951)<br><br><em>The story in a nutshell:</em><br>Not so much of a traditional plot-based story, <em>The Catcher in the Rye</em> is instead a look at a 48-hour block in the life of an American teen named Holden Caulfield, a skinny and obnoxious kid who comes from a generally comfortable, decent family on the east coast, but who for some reason just seemingly can't get along with anyone or fit in anywhere. In fact, as the novel opens, Holden has just gotten kicked out of yet another private prep school; it is right before holiday, in fact, with his family expecting him home in two days anyway, so he's decided to just hoof it around the New York area for the next 48 hours and spend some time thinking about his life.<br><br>As a result, not much of note actually happens to Holden over the next two days -- he visits an old teacher he doesn't like very much, invites an ex-girlfriend he doesn't like very much to go traveling with him, eventually ends up in Manhattan, then back at his parents' place, and then finally an amusement park while entertaining his little sister. The main point of the book, then, is to try to understand Holden as a character and deeply flawed human; to watch the way he looks at life, to notice the way he idolizes his older brother, out in Hollywood and making a living as a screenwriter. Holden is both restless and old-fashioned, tender and cruel, someone who is sometimes blurting out uncomfortable truths and sometimes lying right to your face. And by the time we're done, hopefully we've learned something not only about him in particular but about teens in general, and especially the sense of alienation and standoffishness that comes to so many at that age no matter when in history we're talking about.<br><br><em>The argument for it being a classic:</em><br>The argument for this being a classic is a clean and simple one -- it is demonstrably the very first book in history to establish the "confessional young adult" genre, one that has grown in our modern times to accommodate tens of thousands of books and millions of grateful teen fans. Before <em>Catcher in the Rye</em>, its fans say, there were only two types of stories considered appropriate for younger readers -- either moralistic tales that very sternly taught right from wrong, or the kind of psuedo-science babble mysteries like I was mentioning last week, when I was reviewing <em>20,000 Leagues Under the Sea</em>. Salinger was the very first person to publish a book about a teen written from the teen's point of view himself, a very raw point of view that contains sex, filth, cursing galore, and all the other prurient stuff that comes with peeking inside a 16-year-old boy's head; it was a breakthrough of the Modernist era, fans claim, one of those seminal projects that broke the ground for all the naturalistic books and films in the '50s, '60s and '70s that came afterwards. Oh, and if this weren't enough, it just also happens to be the most censored book in the history of the United States, as well as a personal favorite of both Mark David Chapman (who killed John Lennon) and John Hinckley Jr (who shot Ronald Reagan); these facts alone almost guarantee it a spot on any list of classics.<br><br><em>The argument against:</em><br>The main argument against this being a classic seems to be that it's become a victim of its own success; indeed, <em>Catcher in the Rye</em> has been so influential over the decades, its critics say, an entire genre of "Salingeresque" work now exists (which like I said is more formally known as "confessional young adult"), many books of which are actually much better than the original that started them all. After all, let's admit it, <em>Catcher in the Rye</em> has its problems, ones typical of any young and inexperienced writer (which Salinger was when first penning this); just as one good example, there are only so many times you can use the word 'g-ddam' in one story before it becomes a self-parodying joke. Like many of the books being reviewed in this essay series, I don't think there's a single human out there who would deny this novel's historical importance; but that's not what we're trying to determine here with the CCLaP 100, but rather whether it's a book you personally should read before you die.<br><br><em>My verdict:</em><br>So imagine my shock when I found myself finishing this book and saying to myself, "My God -- JD Salinger is basically Judy Blume with more cursing." (Or to be completely fair, I guess that should be worded -- "My God, Judy Blume is basically JD Salinger with Jews and menstruation.") I guess I had been expecting a lot more, given what a supernaturally high regard this book has among such a large swath of the general population; I was expecting it to not only be a good Young Adult novel (which it admittedly is) but also something that was going to reveal some sort of transcendent truth about the world to me as a fully-grown adult.<br><br>Er...it doesn't. This is just a good Young Adult novel, and you owe it to yourself to know that going into it; that unless you're a teen yourself when you read it, there really isn't going to be anything too terribly original or groundbreaking found in this manuscript. In fact, you could argue that Salinger was quite smart to basically wall himself off from the press and general public after this book, and never publish again (he's still alive, by the way, for those who don't know, reputedly living a happy and quiet life somewhere on the Atlantic Seaboard); because ultimately this is not a great book but simply a good one, eventually made legendary because of the time period it was published, and the subsequent reclusive career that Salinger has had. Its overwhelming historical significance I think earns it a place on the classics list, plus the fact that it's not actually a bad book at all; it's just that this is a kind of book that adults have already read many times before, especially if you were a fan of such authors as Betsy Byars when you were a teen yourself. <br><br><strong>Is it a classic?</strong> I suppose </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></span>

Holden (which is the name of a car) is just a vehicle to "understand" the WW2. See my review. When you understand that Salinger couldn't say what he knew about this war so he wrote it as a children's book... Just like Felix Salten in Bambi (not the Disney version, which is probably why Salinger didn't get his published.<br><br>Salinger tells you this is nit a David Copperfield story.  So don't read it like it is about Holden.  Hint: look at the first page of David Copperfield to understand "Caiulfields" name.<br><br>I hope you will reread it again.  This time when you get to the Merry go round play the music Salinger said was playing, and see if that makes sense or if he is using this book to tell you about money, power and war.</br></br></br></br></span>

Lewis">The Magician's Nephew</a>, I realized how hopelessly wrong I was. <br>With <em>The Catcher in the Rye</em>, I'm faced with the same realization all over again.<br><br>Some books are written so well, so masterfully that you are bound to get the message the writer had slipped in, skilfully, somewhere between its pages for the perceptive reader to find and cherish like treasure, only if you care to lay off the preordained feelings and biases.<br><br>Sure, I agree, nothing ever happens in this book. The prose, in Holden's own overused words, can be described as <em>'boring'</em> and insipid in my own. But that is what Salinger had wanted it to be.<br><br>I'm pretty sure I wouldn't have liked Holden had I read this as a teen. I would've considered him a whiny, nitpicking pain in the rear. A kid trying to sound and behave like an adult and, of course, failing at it miserably. <br>But now that I'm a full-fledged adult, capable of knowing what I want and what I don't, I can understand Holden much better. And I can't help but feel a sort of grudging respect for Holden's daring act of breaking away even if for a little while, from the compulsions and responsibilities that life threw his way, the expectations of peers and adults surrounding him.<br>His voice is so full of recalcitrance, loneliness, resentment and all the amorphous emotions of that age, that it's near impossible not to relate to it. <br>A sense of pure isolation, a feeling of being adrift in the big, bad world, sometimes with barely anything or anyone acting as an anchor. Faced with problems you previously did not even know existed, an ever-widening gap with the members of the opposite sex. A mass of confusing, blurry thoughts swirling inside your head that you would rather prefer to push away than disentangle one by one and analyze. Sometimes not being sure of what you want to do and what you are supposed to do. Stuck somewhere in a time-warp, on the brink of adulthood yet not quite so. Demanding to be treated with respect and dignity like an adult, yet to be loved as a child. <br>I'm sure we have all gone through the same motions at some point of time in our lives.<br>Holden reminds us of that period even if we may not see in him the teenager each one of us had been, individually. He is simply a personification of those confusing, bitter, hazy years that precede the surer, firmer, more secure years.<br>And if we maybe honest enough with ourselves we'll find a Holden, all holed up somewhere in the darkest recesses of our psyche, eternally disdainful and critical of the people and things around him. It's just that we've gotten better at keeping <em>'him'</em> hidden and swallowing urges to lash out at the <em>'phoniness'</em> of it all. <br>Holden's appeal is timeless. And I'm quite sure, I'll like this book when I read it again, years down the line. <br>And for this reason alone, <em>The Catcher in the Rye</em> rightly deserves a place in the halls of classic American literature.<br>This is <strong>THE</strong> YA novel. And, perhaps, will always be. <br><br><strong>P.S:-</strong> My love for this book is not to be interpreted as an endorsement of teenage delinquency or rebellious/anti-social behavior. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></span>

I was first attracted to it as a blessedly upfront dialogue with gritty language after abandoning David Copperfield in disgust.  What do you know?  He makes a funny little reference against the Charles Dickens monstrocity in the first few sentences.   That almost gets Salinger one more star from me on principal.  <br><br>However, I can't say that the interest stuck.  This book is the epitome of depression-filled, angsty gobbledygook that high schools shove down teenagers throats in an effort to make them think deep thoughts - or to attempt to relate to them somehow.  It's true that there were many times that I felt depressed and alienated in high school.  Somehow reading about it in literature did nothing for any sort of need for me.  Maybe it does for some people, but I think it was bad enough dealing with it in reality than reading some dismal thing and exploring its dark depths of depravity.<br><br>I really don't know why they advertise such emotionally unstable stuff to a group of people with raging hormones anyway.  I'm not saying to ban it.  People should be able to read what they want.  I just don't think it should be required reading.  It seems to be fuel for more depression.<br><br>I mean this in sardonic facetiousness: it's not the swearing dialogue, or the character's behavior that makes it so inappropriate.  It's the fact that one might want to slash their wrists after this read.   We always talked about how we're supposed to talk about and reflect how literature affects us in school.  Then we wonder why a huge percentage of people are pumped up on prozac and other happy pills.  :P</br></br></br></br></br></br></span>

<span id="freeText671361281775851737" style="display:none">I think if this book makes you sad then you're reading it wrong. Sure, Holden's angsty and mean, but nothing bad happens to him. In fact, the events of Catcher in the Rye are nothing but positive for Holden Caulfield, because he grows. This book doesn't show teenagers that this anger that Holden holds is valid and normal; in fact, it shows the opposite: that whatever is bringing you down can be overcome. The majority of book, Holden's behavior is guided by his obsession with genuineness and his obsession with innocence. Both of these ideas stem from the death of his brother Allie. Holden feels at least in part guilty(though he has no reason to) over the death of his brother, and one of the main characteristics of his brother that he focuses on is innocence. Holden can't project Allie's red hair on everyone he cares about (though Holden's love for his red hat may stem from this connection), but he can project his innocence, which is why Holden wants so badly to protect Pheobe and Jane. At the end of the book, Holden realizes that he can't protect them forever, symbolized by him letting Pheobe ride the carousel. However, the greater point in this is that Holden is letting go of Allie. He accepts that Pheobe has to grow up, even though Allie never got to. He gives up his red hat. At the end of the book, Holden moves on.<br><br>Though I don't think most teenagers have lost a younger brother, most people, regardless of their age, have something hanging over their head that guides their actions in a negative way, whether the realize it or not. The Catcher in the Rye is the story of Holden letting go of this negative influence, and it should inspire and guide other people to do the same. Holden may be a teenager, but this book isn't just about teenagers. It's about everyone whose ever had trouble letting go of something in their past, and this book is liberating, not depressing.</br></br></span>

That red cover has occasionally caught my eye and I'd toy with the idea of revisiting Holden's story. But I've been afraid. What if Holden didn't stand up to the pedestal he occupies in memory? What if J.D. Salinger isn't as amazing of a writer as I once remembered? When he died, I knew it was time to justify that position on my favorite books shelf.<br><br>It took me a week and half to read this book because I wanted to savor it. What a powerful story teller (if only he'd learn how to break a few paragraphs every once in awhile). Love or hate Holden, you <em>get</em> Holden. That moment when he held the snowball and looked out over the snowy street below, unable to throw the snowball because it looked too pretty, was such a fabulous example of showing us Holden's personality and his insecurities about himself in the world, that it made me smile. So much of his quirky personality, word choice, exaggerations and the way J.D. Salinger writes it with such power and metaphor made me smile (well minus the use of about the only swear words that makes me cringe).<br><br>I have a weakness for good boy protagonists. Girls get whiny and annoying, but boys bottle it up so you want to protect them. I found the scene where Holden fights with his roommate for saying he messed around with a girl he liked so powerful. You can feel the emotion breathing off Holden and know exactly what he's thinking despite what he says. For all his angst, Salinger gives us enough of his emotional breakdowns and his show of good heart that you feel for him, even if you want to shake him. Dealing with his brother's death and his insecurities about living up to his family, he's falling apart, but even those who see that he needs don't get that his alienation and apathy are self preservation. I can't help but think that he wanted to protect kids so much because he needed someone protecting him. He's such a child, his whole character full of irony. He needs his own catcher in the rye, standing on the edge of that cliff to make sure he doesn't fall.</br></br></br></br></br></br></span>

This goes with how Mr. Antolini gave a new perspective to his analogy of the rye, but instead says that Holden is falling simply out of this world from apathy and lost hope for society. His "catcher in the rye" was his sister Phoebe, and this is shown with his iconic red hunter's hat. She saves him literally from himself. He may not have made much progress from how he was in the beginning, but there was enough to be significant (in my opinion).</span>

I just went back and re-read the scene where she pulled the hat out of his pocket and put it on his head. It's even richer now. After Holden freaked out when Mr. Antolini showed him affection and Phoebe moved away when he put his hands on his shoulders, she reached out to him and kissed him and that's when she put his hunter's hat back on his head.

Every time I hear someone gushing about Catcher in the Rye and it's nonsensical ramblings a little part of me dies. <br><br>Every time someone finishes this book and puts it down thoughtfully, tilting their head in mock understanding as they furrow their childish brows, Satan laughs and high fives J.D. Salinger amidst Hell's furious flames.<br><br>When Catcher in the Rye is read aloud backwards from finish to start, it opens up an extra-dimensional portal where Lovecraftian horrors spew endlessly into our peaceful world. When it's read aloud forwards from start to finish, people fall asleep from boredom.<br><br>Your evil twin loves Catcher in the Rye and twirls his or her's nefarious pencil thin mustache while reading it. They laugh their evil doppleganger laugh while thinking of evil ways to ruin your life thanks to J.D. Salinger.<br><br>In his early days, Salinger pulled a thorn out of a witch's foot who granted him a wish, which was to write the great American novel. Unfortunately, the witch's foul magicks were encapsulated in the book, Catcher in the Rye and Salinger hung himself in shame immediately after it's publishing.<br><br>I could literally go on and on for days like this. This book is awful and if you like it you're a putz.<br><br>I'm sorry... it's just... I'm sorry.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></span>

I suppose I'm a putz and it isn't really worth arguing with you about any of this, but I'll tell you what, the reason I love this book so much is because it's so honest. It just flat out tells things the way they are. Frankly, I thought he was hilarious. He always seemed to exaggerate everything, with his "it killed me" or, and even though he was going through a really rough time, how he'd get so excited about things. It made me smile. I can relate to it a lot, actually, with my "worthless life", and I feel like most people CAN relate to this book, at least a little. How he thinks is all over the place, which is so much how I think. It's perfect for an angsty teen, which is exactly what I am. Anyway, that's all, I was just trying to help you see maybe WHY people love it so much.</span>

<span id="freeText3675680027817831829" style="display:none">In lieu of an actual review for this classic, I'll simply post from another message board where I discussed my current re-read of it, specifically the fact that so many people despise it for one reason or another:<br><br>Having finally given Catcher the time it deserved (I never finished it first time round) I can now honestly say that not appreciating it means you missed the point. <br><br>I can see how it could be unlikeable. Holden is an annoying narrator. He vascilates from one opinion to the opposite in the span of a page, he rambles on often, he's got a low tolerance threshhold, and there are times he's just an ass. But, er, that's the point. If you don't like Holden, Salinger did his job.<br><br>On the same token, I find it hard to hate Holden, because I see bits of me in him. Less now than when I look back on when I was his age, but I think most teens should be able to relate to Holden, especially male teens. If you can't, you're either incredibly well adjusted, and if that's the case, you lucked out, or you're the sort of person that drives someone to become Holden, jaded by everything before graduating High School, convinced everyone is phony... not that Holden himself isn't phony at times, but every teen is. <br><br>The book isn't about events. The events are commonplace. They're supposed to be. It's about the character, and what he says, and to extrapolate, what it means. You could say it's cautionary, that Salinger is laughing at the spoiled rich brat he's writing Holden as, and that we the reader should take it as warning not to become him. We could see it as dystopian, that Salinger was commenting on the shallowness of American culture through the eyes of a child, one well-off enough to both see its most glaring pettiness as well as partake in it's seedier aspects. You could even see it as a bit of a commentary about what really matters... about how even the most cynical teen out there still has something they love (in Holden's case, family). You could even take that a step further, and see it psychologically... what damage a loss like that of Allie could cause in a young mind, etc. There's a lot to look into in The Catcher in the Rye... even the admittedly weak explaination of the title could spark discussion as to what it says about or means in terms of his character. <br><br>These are just the impressions I get from it... hardly researched, but then, the best book discussions shouldn't come from research but from your heart. I just think that with many classics, people start looking for something huge... a big, rollicking plot, some amazing humour or poetic language, and sometimes the brilliance of a book is so much more subtle. Not that Holden can't turn a phrase, and certainly not to say that there are times when Holden's sheer contradictory nature jumps the line into humorous, and not even to say there aren't some big and poignant moments in the mundanity (word?) of the plot... simply that in a book like this, even those moneymaker bits are understated. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></span>

<span id="freeText6859942547879405022" style="display:none">Excellent review.  You nailed it. This tale of Holden's descent into the looney bin is so descriptive, I can't believe most of these reviewers got bored with the character and missed the point: we are all different; just because he's young, affected, neurotic, crazy, bored, boring, juvenile, etc., this is HIS story.  If you ever went thru what I did as a teenager and a 19-year-old in 'Nam, then you'll understand.  Otherwise,just get out the Windex and clean your spotless, squeaky-clean experience on this plane in case there's a bit of dust to annoy you!</span>

<span id="freeText15903651299579414931" style="display:none">Cosmic: I don't doubt Salinger couldn't have had a deeper intention, and perhaps some day I will re-read with your ideas in mind. However, as I think is clear to you given your reading, every text can tell multiple stories. This is the beauty of reading, is it not? For a couple totally relevant examples, consider the original intentions of Baum's Oz or Carroll's Alice: both had very specific, very dull, and very forgotten purposes, yet both texts endure due to the surface pleasures and the more tangible, universal lessons.<br><br>As such, no matter how intentionally or cleanly a WWII narrative fits the story (and I certainly don't doubt it could be the case, or that you have evidence for it), Holden himself must have a purpose, and his persona must have a purpose. No matter what other layers exist, Catcher in the Rye is about Holden. It can also be about other things, but it is the story of Holden which would paint these other aspects. Holden would be the lens through which WWII was seen, in your example. To get at what Salinger is saying, whether it is commentary on a wayward culture or allegory for the  horror and aftermath of the war, one needs to understand Holden.</br></br></span>

There were some very genuine moments in this novel that I quite enjoyed. Glad to say I've finally gotten around to reading it.</br></br></span>

<span id="freeText12221400857742656105" style="display:none">Jerome David Salinger was an American author, best known for his 1951 novel <em>The Catcher in the Rye</em>, as well as his reclusive nature. His last original published work was in 1965; he gave his last interview in 1980. Raised in Manhattan, Salinger began writing short stories while in secondary school, and published several stories in the early 1940s before serving in World War II. In 1948 he published the critically acclaimed story "A Perfect Day for Bananafish" in <em>The New Yorker</em> magazine, which became home to much of his subsequent work. In 1951 Salinger released his novel <em>The Catcher in the Rye</em>, an immediate popular success. His depiction of adolescent alienation and loss of innocence in the protagonist Holden Caulfield was influential, especially among adolescent readers. The novel remains widely read and controversial,  selling around 250,000 copies a year.<br><br>The success of <em>The Catcher in the Rye</em> led to public attention and scrutiny: Salinger became reclusive, publishing new work less frequently. He followed <em>Catcher</em> with a short story collection, <em>Nine Stories</em> (1953), a collection of a novella and a short story, <em>Franny and Zooey</em> (1961), and a collection of two novellas, <em>Raise High the Roof Beam, Carpenters</em> and <em>Seymour: An Introduction</em> (1963). His last published work, a novella entitled "Hapworth 16, 1924", appeared in <em>The New Yorker</em> on June 19, 1965.<br><br>Afterward, Salinger struggled with unwanted attention, including a legal battle in the 1980s with biographer Ian Hamilton and the release in the late 1990s of memoirs written by two people close to him: Joyce Maynard, an ex-lover; and Margaret Salinger, his daughter. In 1996, a small publisher announced a deal with Salinger to publish "Hapworth 16, 1924" in book form, but amid the ensuing publicity, the release was indefinitely delayed. He made headlines around the globe in June 2009, after filing a lawsuit against another writer for copyright infringement resulting from that writer's use of one of Salinger's characters from <em>The Catcher in the Rye.</em> Salinger died of natural causes on January 27, 2010, at his home in Cornish, New Hampshire.<br/></br></br></br></br></span>
