<p>“True inspiration is impossible to fake,” explains a character in Christopher Nolan’s existentialist heist film <strong><em>Inception</em></strong>.  If that’s the case, then <em>Inception</em> is one of the most honest films ever made.  Nolan has crafted a movie that’s beyond brilliant and layered both narratively and thematically.  It requires the audience to take in a collection of rules, exceptions, locations, jobs, and abilities in order to understand the text, let alone the fascinating subtext.  Nolan’s magnum opus is the first major blockbuster in over a decade that’s demanded intense viewer concentration, raised thoughtful and complex ideas, and wrapped everything all in a breathlessly exciting action film.  <em>Inception</em> may be complicated, but simply put it’s one of the best movies of the year.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span id="more-38135"></span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>“I’m asking you to take a leap of faith.”</em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><a href="http://cdn.collider.com/wp-content/uploads/Inception-movie-image-26.jpg"><img alt="Inception-movie-image" class="size-thumbnail wp-image-34084 aligncenter" height="400" src="http://cdn.collider.com/wp-content/uploads/Inception-movie-image-26-600x400.jpg" title="Inception-movie-image (26)" width="600"/></a><br/>
</em></p>
<p><em>Inception</em> requires so much exposition that a lesser director would have forced theaters to distribute pamphlets to audience members in order to explain the complicated world he’s developed.  During my first draft of this view, I realized I had spent three paragraphs simply trying to explain the plot.  I will simply avoid this exposition and present the movie’s basic premise.  <em>Inception</em> centers on a team of individuals led by an “extractor” named Cobb (Leonardo DiCaprio) who, through the use of a special device, construct the dreams of a target and use those dreams to implant an idea so that the target will make a decision beneficial to the individual who hired the team.  To say that scratches the surface would be an insult to both scratches and surfaces.  But since it takes Nolan about fifty minutes to set everything up, I hope you’ll forgive my brevity.</p>
<p>Why is it so difficult to explain the plot in depth?  First, I don’t want to spoil you.  Secondly, the film layers dreams on top of dreams to the point where a unique keepsake called a “totem” is required in order to inform a character as to whether or not he or she is still dreaming.  Then you have people in particular roles like “The Architect”, “The Forger”, and “The Chemist” in order to pull off the job.  Furthermore, dreams have rules: dying in a dream forces the dreamer to wake up, delving too deeply into a mind can cause an eternal slumber called “Limbo”, using memories to construct dreams is dangerous because it can blur the line between dreams and reality.  In addition, intruding in the dreams of another will cause the dreamer’s “projections” (human representations created by the dreamer) to attack the intruders like white blood cells going after an infection.  And these explanations only represent a fraction of the terminology, rules, exceptions, or details that are necessary for creating the world of <em>Inception</em>.</p>
<p>But it’s not a confusing movie if you provide it with your full attention.  There are a lot of summer movies that ask you turn off your brain and enjoy the persistent-vegetative-state ride.  <em>Inception</em> is not one of those movies. There’s a lot to take in, but the imaginative and thoughtful delivery of exposition keeps the viewer riveted despite the amount of information required in order to understand the premise, setting, and plot.</p>
<p>It tends to be the case that lots of rules create lots of loopholes.  Filmmakers can use these to cheat and let audiences fill in the leaps of logics. But <em>Inception</em> always plays fair.  It will twist your mind but it’s not a film built on twists.  It’s a film built on possibilities and the boldness of pursuing those possibilities.  On my first viewing, the film experienced a technical malfunction where a misplaced reel skipped the movie forward by twenty minutes and then played the scene upside down and in reverse.  <em>Inception</em> had already sent the audience through such a strange narrative labyrinth that almost everyone in the theater wasn’t sure if something had gone wrong or if Nolan had just made another bold decision.</p>
<p>The film deserves, demands, and rewards repeat viewings, but from your first viewing you can grasp the events on screen and how they interact with each other as long as you force yourself to be an active viewer.  But with set pieces so intricate, so jaw-dropping, and so breathtaking, you’ll find that there’s no exertion needed to stay focused.  You’ll already be swept up in the whirlwind.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>“And I will lead them on a merry chase.”</em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><a href="http://cdn.collider.com/wp-content/uploads/Inception-movie-image-6.jpg" target="_blank"><img alt="Inception-movie-image" class="size-thumbnail wp-image-34064 aligncenter" height="400" src="http://cdn.collider.com/wp-content/uploads/Inception-movie-image-6-600x400.jpg" title="Inception-movie-image" width="600"/></a><br/>
</em></p>
<p><em>Inception</em> features one of the best fight scenes of all-time.  Take a moment to consider that: in the entire history of cinema, of every fight scene that has ever taken place, the one in this movie is among the best.  Watching a fight without gravity is incredible.  It’s not like in <em>The Matrix</em> where a character can defy gravity if they choose.  The fight scene in <em>Inception</em> has no gravity to defy and Arthur (played by Joseph Gordon-Levitt), the team’s point man, has to figure out how to achieve his objective while fending off projections.  I can only hope that someday in the distant future, when people with free time are on a space station in zero-gravity, they will re-enact this scene.  In the meantime, Nolan’s spectacular visual effects will have to suffice.</p>
<p>With the exception of one set piece (which I’ll get to in a moment), the action scenes in <em>Inception</em> are spectacular.  Visually lush and imaginative, Nolan transforms car chases into countdowns, fistfights into puzzles, and shootouts into…well, shootouts.  There’s a mission on a snowy mountainside that doesn’t work as well as the other set pieces because there’s a poor sense of location, a lack of visual diversity, and sloppy editing.  But that doesn’t really halt or hurt the film because Nolan brilliantly placed the car chase, the fistfight, and the shootout on top of each other.  You would think this would cause action fatigue, but by cutting between three set pieces and having what happens in one set piece affect the others, the action climax of <em>Inception</em> isn’t exhausting—it’s exhilarating.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>“If you’re going to perform inception, you need imagination.”</em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><a href="http://cdn.collider.com/wp-content/uploads/Inception-movie-image-41.jpg" target="_blank"><img alt="Inception-movie-image" class="size-thumbnail wp-image-34099 aligncenter" height="251" src="http://cdn.collider.com/wp-content/uploads/Inception-movie-image-41-600x251.jpg" title="Inception-movie-image" width="600"/></a><br/>
</em></p>
<p>You can be the best action director around but you can only get so far if you lack characters worth caring about.  With <em>Inception</em>, every character not only has a particular skill and task, but has a personality that mirrors their job description.</p>
<p>We learn about the characters of <em>Inception</em> not from long monologues about their past or even (with the exception of Cobb) delving into their dreams and memories.  We learn about them by how they interact with each other.  The small moments between Arthur and Eames, “The Forger” (Tom Hardy) indicate years of working on j tolerating each other on jobs but with no animosity between the two.  Neophyte “Architect” Ariadne (Ellen Page) is a total jerk towards Cobb, but she’s the only one who’s willing to cut through his bullshit.  Cobb’s relationship with his wife Mal (Marion Cotillard) is the heart of <em>Inception</em>.  The interactions among the supporting characters are standard for a well-made action movie, but the relationship between Cobb and Mal is yet another reason why <em>Inception</em> stands apart.</p>
<p>DiCaprio will take some flack for playing a similar character to his one in <strong><em>Shutter Island</em></strong> from earlier this year.  Both Cobb and Teddy Daniels have become separated from their families, suffer from unbearable guilt, and have a tough time handling the nature of reality.  Here’s another similarity: DiCaprio is great in both movies.  I wouldn’t worry about him getting typecast as tragic-figure-with-tenuous-grasp-on-reality-as-a-result-of-intense-guilt-and-regret.</p>
<p>Two of the film’s stars will (hopefully) find their careers at the next level after this movie opens.  Their names are “Joseph Gordon-Levitt” and “Tom Hardy”.  Gordon-Levitt has excelled at playing lost boys, tortures souls, and recently a charming male lead in <strong><em>(500) Days of Summer</em></strong>.  You can now add “bad-ass blockbuster action star” to that list.  Gordon-Levitt’s versatility is why I will be excited for any movie that lists him as one of its stars.</p>
<p>Hardy’s critically acclaimed performance in Nicolas Winding Refn’s <strong><em>Bronson</em></strong> brought him to Hollywood’s attention.  His performance in <em>Inception</em> will bring him the attention of countries.  He brings a light-hearted touch to the film and while the script forces other characters to remain serious, Eames takes a more laid back approach to the mind-heist game.  But he’s not comic relief and he’s not around to comment on absurd circumstances.  Like everyone in the cast, he’s there to help the team achieve their goal (although the script functions in such a way that you could see each character as a representation of a specific idea).</p>
<p>The only actor who’s a little shaky is Ken Watanabe who plays Saito, the team’s employer.  His performance is great.  He pulls off the impressive feat of being threatening without being menacing.  The only problem is that Watanabe’s Japanese accent is so thick that it’s sometimes difficult to make out what he’s saying.  In a movie where the dialogue is as delicately crafted as the rest of the film, it’s unfortunate to lose a few lines due to something as simple as pronunciation.  And it’s only noticeable because everything in <em>Inception</em> is so finely crafted.</p>
<p><em> </em></p>
<p>The physical scope of this movie is astounding.  Worlds fall on top of each other, a freight train can burst onto a city street, hotels can lose all gravity, and everything that we know is impossible appears completely natural.  It’s not enough to say that the cinematography is gorgeous, or that the sound design is sensational, or that this is one of composer Hans Zimmer’s all-time best scores.  There aren’t “supporting” elements in <em>Inception</em>.  Just as the film layers its narrative structure and thematic subtext, so it does with its technical elements.  You will notice the cinematography and the art direction and the sounds and the score.  It’s like hearing beautiful solos mixed together in a glorious anthem.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>“Dreams feel real while we’re in them.  It’s only when we wake up that we realize something was actually strange.”</em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><a href="http://cdn.collider.com/wp-content/uploads/Inception-movie-image-38.jpg" target="_blank"><img alt="Inception-movie-image" class="size-thumbnail wp-image-34096 aligncenter" height="251" src="http://cdn.collider.com/wp-content/uploads/Inception-movie-image-38-600x251.jpg" title="Inception-movie-image" width="600"/></a><br/>
</em></p>
<p><em> </em></p>
<p>As you’ve probably guessed, when I said at the beginning of this review that <em>Inception</em> was the first movie in over a decade to mix breathtaking action with thoughtful subtext, I was referring to 1999′s <em>The Matrix</em>.  The comparisons are inevitable.  Both movies deal with the nature of reality combined with pulse-pounding set pieces that will be included in any action-scene highlight reel.  But <em>The Matrix</em> is a freshman level course compared to the doctorate held by <em>Inception</em>, and it has nothing to do with how far special effects have come in ten years.  It’s about taking multiple genres, settings, ideas, emotions, and questions and weaving them into a rich tapestry that will have folks talking long after the credits roll.  But then you throw in those advanced special effects and you have a summer blockbuster that will blow your mind.</p>
<p>You’ve never seen anything like <em>Inception</em>, and you’ll want to see it again and again.</p>
<p>Rating: A</p>

Can’t believe he is the little boy from Angels in the out field!! Love to see him move he is a talented and excellent actor!! Iception has to be watch atleast 4 or 5 times to know whats going on. It looks good by confusing. Feels like a kind of matrix or takers more complex!! Ready for him to get a starring role. Hall way fight scene is matrix like.</p>

<p>I agree it looked lovely and the acting was brilliant, but the film left me cold.</p>

Would describe it as one long, VERY long music video.<br/>
What the $#$^$!  I didn’t go to see a music video. I went to see a frickin feature film.<br/>
One observation I’ve made is that adding music to a scene of often over used because<br/>
the director or producer may feel that the acting or story is not strong enough, so instead they drown it out with EPIC music. I think this is cinematic insecurity.<br/>
LOL</p>
<p>Oh yeah,<br/>
The Japanese guy overacts much of the time.<br/>
Best guys for me were the English bloke and Leonardo.<br/>
The young mind-driller girl looked RIDICULOUS in the ski mask. She looked like a mini-chipmunk. I laughed out loud during these snow scenes.<br/>

The music was a subtle background piece that, not only played a major part in the movies itself, but also exentuated the action. All of these actors were phenomenal and for you to say that Ellen Paige looked “RIDICULOUS” is just your way of presenting us with your own insecurity and inability to actually find something wrong with this film.

<p>It is the best movie I've seen so far this year. I will for sure see it again. Great acting, score, directing, action, etc. It def stays with you after you leave the theatre. The problem I had with it was the ending. NOw, the ending didn't ruin the movie for me, but it wasn't needed. <br/>The ending is open ended. I have always hated endings that leave the door open for multiple possibilities. To me it is the easy way out. Directors should stick to their guns and pick and ending and die by it. But for whatever reason, open ended endings are seen as “brilliant.”<br/>The reason the open ending didn't ruin the whole movie for me is because to me, it is actually pretty clear how it ends. The final shot was just thrown in their to make people think twice. That was the shocking part. I never thought C Nolan would have an ending like that. A shot put it to deliberately frustrate you. <br/>But apparently that's why people say it's a masterpiece, because it forces you to analyze what you just saw. Sorry but too easy.</p>

<div class="dsq-comment-message" id="dsq-comment-message-64224"><p>It’s much more clear and straight forward the second time.<br/>
To me it’s clear he wakes up. The movie is about letting go of whatever is bothering you. Wether it be guilt or shame, whatever. CObb had to get over his guilt over the death of his wife. At the end he tells his wife that she isn’t real and that he has to move on. He then stays in limbo to look for Saito so Saito can make the call that would let Cobb into the states.<br/>
Theres no reason for him to stay in a dream state. They accomplished the mission and he was able to put his guilt to rest. When he gets home and he spins the top he walks away because he knows he’s not dreaming he doesn’t have to see if it fall. And yes the top was losig momentum and was about to topple before they cut to black. In a dream world the top never wobbled, always a fast zip on it.</p>
<p>Having said that check out this explanation of the movie. Its cool and works if you think CObb wakes up or stays dreaming.</p>

It's the Matrix meets the Dark Night. Other criticisms: The movie's sound is over powering and at times takes away from scenes that would have done better with overutilized boom in the background; I personal disagree with your assessment Ken Watanabe's acting. I agree with you that the acting was superb and that there was only on ching in the armour. However I disagree that that misstep was Cillian Murphy's he was under-utilized and to be perfectly honest his aciting was VERY muted. He could have been played by a kitchen towel and the audience wouldn't have known the difference.</p>

schizophrenic nightmare on film.  To me… this was totally not believable… the story line did not mesh together.  Ohhhh… three levels…. it could have gone down 6 levels and it still wouldn’t have worked.  Also.. the casting was completely wrong… which was part of the reason why it was ‘unbelievable’.  DiCaprio is one of the worst actors out there…  his wife on film… was completely wrong… like she would have ever fallen for DiCaprio… and then the phony accents on all of them…. but to be fair… the entire cast just didn’t fit or work.  Ill be putting the discs up on ebay immediately…. hopefully I can recoup some of my cost.</p>

A lesser director would've piled us high with spectacular visuals and no plot. Nolan is slightly more sparing with the visuals, but has a juggernaut of a plot, with a fantastic cast all around. Absolutely loved Tom Hardy. After his performance in this and Layer Cake, I'm really hoping we'll get to see more of him. This movie truly shows what I've known ever since I saw Memento, that Christopher Nolan is truly the most exciting director working right now.<br/><a href="http://www.igp-scifi.com/Inception.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.igp-scifi.com/Inception.html</a></p>

Once you get the concept this movie and the effects are w/o questioncomparable and 20 times better then the matrix. Definitely worth seeing more then once Nolan has done it again!</p>

He wasn't able to see his children's faces because he never did in real life. He wasn't able to recreate that from memory or imagination. That's why he turned when Mal told him to look. So at the end, when he finally sees their faces, I think that is undeniable proof that he is not dreaming still. *END SPOILERS*</p>

If hes never seen them how would they even know who he is enough to talk to him on the phone and wish him to come home.  no you are wrong and i think he is in his dreamworld because the children’s ages didn’t change and they were wearing the same clothes as always and were in the same position as always in the memories.</p>

<div class="dsq-comment-message" id="dsq-comment-message-43154"><p>I read this other opinion on the movie. Baiscally The movie is what it is. The last shot was the INCEPION for US, th audience. The whole movie is NOLAN putting the idea in our heads and the last shot signifies the start of the INCEPTION. It makes sense.<br/>If you notice they never show the name of the movie until the end. Last shot sets up the INCEPTION for us, cuts to black and it reads INCEPTION.<br/>Just like NOLAN's last two movies.</p>
<p>BATMAN BEGINS doesn't appear until the end. When BATMAN finally becomes BATMAN.<br/>THE DARK KNIGHT doesn't appear until the end when GORDON calls him that at the end.<br/>THE PRESTIEGE doesn't appear until the end when the final secret is revealed.</p>
<p>It's a good take on the movie and my favorite so far.</p>

It is the first movie I have seen in too long that requires you to think and question reality! Its so so so so so so so so so stupid that the films that deserve the awards most are usually the ones who get looked over while the stupid, pointless movies with horrible acting (aka The Twilight Saga: Eclipse) are the ones that usually end up recieving all of the attention</p>

That, in my opinion, was what made the story great  and original.</p>

<div class="dsq-comment-message" id="dsq-comment-message-43253"><p>Description of “Inception” promised an interesting movie. <br/>If we would only knew!..  I rarely watched anything more repulsive: a good idea being converted to a commercial shit by director Nolan. The movie is just a shocking “trach-bah-bah” shootout – one of those making from a teenage (mostly) audience a bunch of idiots. Sound track (I cannot call this “music”) was equally disgusting, but, fortunately for myself, despite this overwhelmingly loud sounds and senseless shooting, I fell asleep after first 2 hours. Talentless garbage – that is my appraisal.<br/>Concernig DiCaprio: he converts to a commercialized actor. I can't imagine Klein, for instance, taking such a role, even for 10 millions, but.. Klein has a good taste and intelligence.<br/>I do not see, even closest to DiCaprio, Brad Pitt playing in such cheap production.<br/>Sincerely,<br/>T. V. from Illinois</p>

<div class="dsq-comment-message" id="dsq-comment-message-64222"><p>So, if this is a thinking man’s film,  what does it make you think about?  So far, all the comments seem to be about the craft of movie making.  2001 A space odyssey, make me think about man’s quest for knowledge and his place in the Universe.  A Clockwork Orange made me think about the relationship of man and society. One Flew over the Cuckcoo’s Nest make me consider that maybe the inmates are sane and the doctors are the insane.  Even Easy Rider gave me plenty of food for thought.  So is Inception an important film, or is it just really entertaining?</p>

When ideas grow and link together with other ideas they become big stories and can have multiple points of view and tangents.  Large story ideas intertwined with emotion act more like dreams.  There are daydreams when we are awake, and dreams in our mind when we are asleep.  </p>

<div class="dsq-comment-message" id="dsq-comment-message-64271"><p>The wise man is one who proves what can be an “irrational thought” to be rational. Christopher Columbus thought the world was round, and everyone thought he was crazy, but we all know the world is round right? Everyone thought his claims were completely illogical=irrational, but he truly was a genius for establishing that. This movie makes me think about reality itself. This whole movies idea could be happening to us right now, in the sense that we can think it. Reality is hard to understand by some people. The ones who can comprehend reality are the ones who understand what “pre-intellectual” reality is. In order to understand what that is, you have to imagine that everything you see is the past, because a stimulus has to occur (which takes “time”) in your brain, in order to percieve you’re perceptions of the world around us. The direct moment I touch anything is already the past because it takes the stimulus (“time”) for me to comprehend anything thats being thrown at me. Thats what I was thinking during this movie. A Clockwork Orange is supposed to relay that freedom is key to living. The Ludovico Technique takes away freedom, and free will in young Alex. One FLew Over The Cuckoo’s nest is telling us to rebel against totalitarianism. (Patients vs. Ms. Ratched.) I think Inception is an important AND an entertaining film to those who seek to have a destiny in this Chautaque. Im not saying you’re insights to those movies/books were irrellevant, but thats just what I thought of when i read your post. This movie is important AND entertaining in my opinion. </p>

His acting is only improving and we keep learning how versatile of an actor he can be.</p>

The film did a decent job explaining it without boring you with the explanation, just throwing the information at you and going with it. The problem is its just complex enought to make alot of ppl think ” oh man thats so deep and complex ” but it really isn’t that complex and if you take a step back its just a bunch of stuff exploding or falling apart with loud music thrown in. The introduction to the plot was weak to me, (not the inception concept). It was a good movie, it wasn’t a great one like this review tries to make it out to be.</p>

Two many characters not enough personality’s brought forward. To say this is better than the matrix what a joke. It didn’t confuse me in anyway or use my brain that much either in the way I expected from this review but I don’t see the point in the whole movie? can someone enlighten me and don’t give me plant an idea irony bullcrap thank you.</p>

<div class="dsq-comment-message" id="dsq-comment-message-73787"><p>totally right. this movie made a over-stretched mess of a great idea. I love action, SF and fantasy movies but at the basis of it all you have to be drawn into the movie, relate to the character/s in order to go along with their journey. In this movie I didn’t really care about what happens to them – I think as someone has already mentioned the introduction to the plot was poor, they gave up too much at the beginning, and the way that the plot unraveled just seemed to go nowhere. I just didn’t feel the characters were real, and at no point did i forget I’m in a movie theater – so how people compare this to the Matrix is beyond me. </p>

<div class="dsq-comment-message" id="dsq-comment-message-43675"><p>Actually, I think you have it backwards.  The entire movie was most certainly a dream.  This is why the children were always wearing the same clothing, were in the exact same position as he remembered them, and so on…  Heck, notice how in the airport everyone stared at him, as if HE was intruding on a dream?  The whole movie was Cobb trying to pull an Inception ON HIMSELF.  For him to trick himself into believing this.  His wife Mal certainly killed herself and woke up to reality, he just doesn't wan tto believe it.  The projection of Mal is almost certainly his consciousness trying to tell him he is INDEED dreaming.  What a great movie.</p>

I think Kdnato is right. The movie was a dream. Nolan gave too many hints about it at the beginning of the movie. Some thug grapped Cobb and said “You are not in the dream now are you?” How did the thug know personal stuff about Cobb? Copps own mind tries to hold the illusion of reality inside a dream. Other clear tip was when old man in the Chemists cellar looked at Cobb and said something like “You would know all about dream becoming more real than reality”. That is Cobbs mind trying to wake up? These were clear tips and should have peen more subtle in my opinion. The ending is not open but closed and ingenious! Nolan tries to leave audiense in dream where cradle falls and the ending is happy. And that was the whole idea of the movie. Mind choosing more pleasant reality rather than actual reality.</p>

<div class="dsq-comment-message" id="dsq-comment-message-64248"><p>Actually the old man says “The dream has become their reality, who are you sir to take that away.” I don’t think that would be enough to say that the whole tihng is a dream and his sub conciousness trying to tell him to wake up. Also the only people who looked at him oddly at the end were the people he just had a major experience with, with the exception of the cop who can also be explained away if you look at it like this: the cop would have run a check on Cobb to see his imigration status and probably would have seen that he was recently wanted for murder. Something else that keeps the whole movie from being a dream is when Cobb goes to the old Saito in the 4th level of the dream to bring him back to reality, then after that when he sees his children’s faces – like someone else mentioned, it would not be possible for him to see their face as he never actually got to see them, that’s why their faces were always turned away in the dream. You also can look further into it when you look at what happened between Cobb and Mal, they grew old together inside the dream, and when they woke up they were young again, that’s a clear indication of waking up, Besides that I don’t think one could perform inception on ones self, how can one give oneself a genuine idea while knowing you are attempting to give it to yourself? Besides that the whole movie was in trying to perform Inception on someone else, not Cobb.</p>

The movie was not a dream because Cobb is the one who came up with the idea to kill themselves by getting hit with a train.  He understood it was a dream world and he couldn’t see his children’s faces in the dream.  The fact that they were wearing the same clothes means very little.  The director only did this to try and make you question the movie like you are doing know.</p>

<p>The story itself is actually very simple but the way Nolan presents the movie made this movie look complicated. I don't think any director could have done it as interesting as he does. So thumbs up for his masterpiece. Whether this movie is a rip off from various of movies but this movie deserves for your attentions. It's great one and excellent for me in my eyes <img alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" src="http://cdn.collider.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif"/> </p>

I really started to get bored of the dream within in a dream concept which when honest is not very orginal. If this film was written by a master science fiction writer it could have been much more than it was. The creative scope that was possible in this film was completey limitless and just having the idea of planting a thought in someones head to split up there fathers empire to me is not very interesting.</p>

<div class="dsq-comment-message" id="dsq-comment-message-44979"><p>I agree that the citations of The Matrix and Dark City are appropriate. However, I think the dream layering sequences and themes also owe a bit to David Lynch, who in Mulholland Drive (among other films) developed this idea quite well. Even the lightly regarded What Dreams May Come appears to be part of Nolan's lineage. We can trace the theme further, to the mythic tales of those who have ventured into the disorienting and dangerous realm of Hades, whence return is anything but certain. Nolan's palate, in Memento onward, has been the human mind (which, if equated for the sake of argument with the human brain, is as much a labyrinthine structure as anything the movie's “architect” can imagine). From Borges to P. K. Dick, the question “What is real?” has always afforded artists ample room to play. Even – and this may be a stretch – Heisenberg's notion that the object of an observation is changed by the presence of the observer, and the even older theme that the observer is concurrently changed (one is never the same after stepping into the stream, nor is the stream) may be afforded a sort of homage in Nolan's vision: In some respects, the audience is the target on Nolan's inception (just as the object of a search engine's search in the searcher). The sequence of the opposing mirrors when the new architect first begins to test her acumen and to discover the game's rules seems to leave Cobb incredulous, but by then he ought to have known better…</p>

<div class="dsq-comment-message" id="dsq-comment-message-45196"><p>I'm confused as to why anyone thinks this movie is confusing.  They set up a character specifically so they can explain to the audience what is happening, which they do over and over again.  It's a fun movie but that's it.  I don't get the hype.  To me this is a 'shut-off-your-brain-and-enjoy' summer popcorn movie.  That's fine but let's settle down a bit. 7 out of 10 at best.</p>

<div class="dsq-comment-message" id="dsq-comment-message-45478"><p>I thought it was an interesting story, with a well-conceived premise about sharing dreams and some of the possibilities that might go along with such a  concept.  While I was entertained and fairly engaged in how the inception played out, I didn't find the relationship between Cobb and Mal particularly compelling.  It seemed that their history together and their present realities were intended to be a driving force behind the story, but I found that I was only intrigued, rather than invested, in the outcome regarding them…perhaps because so much of the film itself was spent unfolding the plot, rather than spending enough time visiting long enough with them for me to really care who they really were/are…or it might have been more of a question of how that time was spent as opposed to how much of it there was.  </p>
<p>Among other reasons, this is an example of why I felt it was a good film but not a great one.</p>

(Grown Ups came close but after seeing Inception I completely forgot about it) I mean this movies story line was astounding! The actors/actressess all pulled threw to me enough where i beleived that I really knew each one. This movie's perspective changes a lot but never loses its exciting thriller side to it. So Go see it! If you did already, find other people to go see it with who havn”t. I mean I'm glad my friend mentioned it to us.</p>

<div class="dsq-comment-message" id="dsq-comment-message-45698"><p>This movie drops you into the middle of the story and it takes a while to understand what is happening.  That is probably no accident.  I am sure the genesis of this story came from the ideas presented in the Matrix series.  This story is like playing a three dimensional chess game but the director's skill doles out the moves just as you need them.  It doesn't require any kind of super concentration to follow the story but it certainly fill up you head with questions.  The climax involves trying to reconcile four versions of reality- one real world and three dream worlds.  Surprisingly, your head is not hurting with confusion  but rather it is filled with excitement.   This is one I will see again- I'm sure I missed something. </p>
<p> I will say that the very last scene let's the audience decide for themselves what state the dreamer is in when the movie is over.    Wonderful acting all around- a suspense thriller of the first magnitude.  It may win the Oscar for best picture because the editing, sound design, the music, the acting, and special effects are so good.  See it in a theater with a good sound system.</p>

<div class="dsq-comment-message" id="dsq-comment-message-45702"><p>One other comment.  I think it is safe to say that this movie is derivative of the Matrix to some extent but there is an idea in “Inception” that was taken from a sixties movie,  “The Illustrated man”.  In that story, a couple, who are already the dream of other dreamers,  are persuaded that the world will end tomorrow. They want to space their children the horror of the “last day” so decide to euthanize them (a boy and a girl).  But the wife cannot bear to do it so they decide to go to bed and not do the horrible deed but face the tragedy together.  The next morning,  the wife wakes up and shouts,  “It didn't happen!  We are alive”.  She runs to the children's  room and finds her husband in anguish over the bodies of their kids.  He was trying to space them the agony of the End,  but the end didn't come. Sound familiar?  I think no matter how innovative a movie may seem,  it doesn't get ideas out of the blue- still it is legitimate to build a new idea from an old idea even if cinema is borrowing from cinema.</p>

<div class="dsq-comment-message" id="dsq-comment-message-45799"><p>Despite all the good parts, the whole really isn't very good for two reasons.  First, the number one rule of fiction is broken in a huge way – Don't explain but instead show and reveal.  The first half of the movie is packed full of characters explaining what is happening or what will happen, all to establish the premise of dreams within dreams with varying passage of time.  Secondly, the movie makers trap themselves into this premise and plod away at the final suspense/action sequence, cutting between the multiple layers of dreams to the point that each cut starts feeling like a gag – “Oh, now we're in a shooter video game set in snowy mountains…oh, there's the van falling in slow motion again…oh, there's the side kick rolling about on walls and ceilings.  Once the sidekick lassos his buddies together and moves them around in no gravity I couldn't help but laugh out loud, as did a number of people in the theatre.  Other than these two  big flaws there are many others such as – 1. More key characters should have gone through a discovery process across the entire film, figuring out layers of dream and reality along with the audience. 2.  The most intense altered reality scenes are all blown during the young lady architect's training.  3.  Aren't your dreams way, way, way more bizarre and intense than 99% of this movie? 4.  We are given no reason what so ever to really have any concerns about the “bad guys” in this film, nor is there anything that really convinces us that the “good guys” are really in peril.  5.  The moral question of “Is it OK to pirate someone's mind and mess with it?” is never really addressed.  6.  We are given no reason to believe that the inception being executed is really justified.  7.  Why doesn't the grandpa just take the kids on vacation out of the country so they can visit their Daddy?  8.  If you could live a whole life time in a dream world you created with your spouse, would you create a weird, ugly, urban world?  Would you really want to spend that whole life time alone together?  9.  Finally, I can not stand chase/fighting sequences where you can not at least have an idea of where people are, where they are specifically rushing to, and who is who.  This movie was full this kind of badly filmed and edited junk, especially the winter fighting scenes.  This movie is OVER RATED.  Oh yes, as a 35 year fan of mystery and sci fi – the plot WAS NOT COMPLICATED OR HARD TO FOLLOW…IT WAS VERY, VERY PREDICTABLE.</p>

<div class="dsq-comment-message" id="dsq-comment-message-46105"><p>Great review.<br/>However, I found the movie sometimes trips on itself while simultaneously insisting upon itself. Now, that may have been a necessary evil for a film with this type of plot complexity, but I have to agree that it just left me also feeling a bit cold.  Oscar worthy? I think not.  All the players played at their expected levels of excellence. But, I did not see any stand-out performances in this work.  </p>
<p>It was in a word, the 'Anti-Matrix'.  <br/>Almost the same film turned inside-out in it's message.</p>

<div class="dsq-comment-message" id="dsq-comment-message-46199"><p>In real world, the conscious is so obvious that it controls the subconscious but when you dream the subconscious controls the conscious..many a times in your dream you want to do something but your subconscious which you realise is you, does not listen to you and does something else. This is what i call the parallel universe.<br/>Now the movie Inception, it says, that there is this guy who controls his subconscious as much as he controls his conscious, so much, that he creates conscious in the subconscious and spans it to many a levels. maybe i can buy it, but to dream in a dream of others and interlink with each other subconscious to many levels is a little far-fetched. At this point, you will definitely have dreams of all the other people interconnected and it will be so random that none of the events happening in the movie will be in sequence.for example, you will have the di caprio's nightmare and then you will have the girl's nightmare interconnected (suppose the girl has nightmare of seeing a shark attack then when dicaprio see's the train approach the girl's nightmare can happen at the same time)<br/>Technically, i think that di caprio is master-minding all the dreams then the purpose of whole movie is lost. That is, when you dream you can unlock or see the person's conscious and sub conscious and with that he can easily guess the 'safe' combination. in comparision, the matrix is far far better movie than the inception.</p>
<p>bottom line..poorly conceived movie but brilliantly acted and masterfully directed.di caprio as usual is a genius and nolan did a great job.</p>

Many a times in your dream you want to do something but your subconscious which you realize is it does not listen to you and does something else. This is what i call the parallel universe. <br/>Now the movie inception it says that there is this guy who controls his subconscious as much as he controls his conscious so much that he creates conscious in the subconscious and spans it to many a levels.  Maybe i can buy it but to dream in a dream of others and interlink with each other subconscious to many levels is a little far-fetched.  At this point you will definitely have dreams of all the other people interconnected and it will be so random that none of the events happening in the movie will be in sequence.  For example, you will have the Di Caprio’s nightmare and then you will have the girl’s nightmare interconnected (suppose the girl has nightmare of seeing a shark attacking while Dicaprio see the train). Technically i think that Dicaprio is master-minding all the dreams then the purpose of whole movie is lost.  That is when you dream you can unlock or see the person’s conscious and sub conscious and with that he can easily guess the ‘safe’ combination. In comparison, the matrix is a far far better movie than the Inception.<br/>Bottom line..poorly conceived movie but brilliantly acted and masterfully directed. DiCaprio as usual is a genius and Nolan did a great job.</p>

Alot of critics are far too harsh and to be honest do not take really have a idea about what a good film is. Great film, saw it in the cinema and got completely involved. I would just like to say that the film itself is not that hard to understand it just requires your attention the whole way through, the concepts it introduces are not that hard to understand.</p>

<div class="dsq-comment-body" id="dsq-comment-body-46617">
<div class="dsq-comment-message" id="dsq-comment-message-46617"><p>Lets assume what we have seen in the 1st half of the movie, i.e. right after the beginning set of “Dom Cobb (Leonardo) washed up to a beach … and then with an old man (Saito) tells Cobb that he had once known a man who had that top with him …” IS NOT a dream.</p>
<p>One interesting puzzle I have for you is if Saito (at the end, the old man) appeared to be 80 or 90 yrs old.  This means he may have trapped in limbo for 40 yrs, say.  What was the real world timeline?</p>
<p>Saito was killed at Level 3 (Snowy mountain scene), and therefore his limbo should be Level 4.  For a time correlation of “10 hours of real world time gives 1 week in the first level dream, 6 months in the second level and 10 years in third level dream.”, Saito's real world “coma” could have been about another 10 hrs after the end of plan flight.  </p>
<p>Assuming my beginning assumption is valid, the scene of young Cobb meeting the aged Saito was possible on one condition that Cobb did actually successfully locate Saito after saying goodbye to Ariadne (when she was going to push Fischer off the building (cliff) and falls down herself, providing the “kick” to leave that Level 4 dream).</p>
<p>But how?  My best guess is for Cobb to provide himself a needed “kick” to leave L4 back to L3 and then enter the scrambled mind of Saito (who was dead at L3: Snowny mountain).  That's one way to explain for the age difference or space time variation.</p>
<p>Therefore my best guess is therefore if elderly Saito dared enough to pull the trigger to kill himself there at the limbo and if he could ever come back to real world, time-wise, this could not possibly stick to the time sequence shown towards the end where Saito woke up and made that phone call to clear the immigration for Cobb.</p>
<p>The inevitable conclusion is Cobb was trapped in the end.  That was not real … sadly but also makes this an truly remarkable movie of 2010 !!!!!</p>

<p>This movie is utter rubbish of no entertainment value.</p>
<p>The script was convoluted, self indulgent and utterly confusing.</p>
<p>The movie is essentially an uninteligable skeleton of a script, padded with digital sets and special effects. Oh, and did I mention fight scene after fight scene, fighting over who knows what?</p>
<p>The gushing reviews here remind me of pretentious would be intellectuals looking at blobs of paint on canvas in a stark white gallery with chardonnay in hand giving stern meaning to the art. When in fact a monkey painted the piece.</p>
<p>We've been made fools by the Film's director Nolan. No wonder it took nearly ten years for the studio to agree to make this film. When Nolan firsts proposed it, it was dismissed. As his stature grew over time, the studio rethought it based on Nolan's prior successes. </p>
<p>A good move is always about a good story and script. Computer special effects don't make a classic. This movie is no classic. </p>
<p>Don't waste your money.</p>

A person on this movie who CAN NOT be overlooked and often is is Han Zimmer. The scores he creates for not only INception, but The Dark Knight, The Last Samurai, and even The Pirates of the Caribbean truley are characters of their own, seeming at times to even dictate the story line. The cast was incredible. A huge kudos to the casting department.  Oscars, here they come!!!</p>

<div class="dsq-comment-message" id="dsq-comment-message-46890"><p>there was much to recommend it, no dispute there, although it would've benefited quite a bit in my opinion from less of the by now typical car-chase/shootout/explosives scenes, but despite my reservations about this sort of mundane overkill, and even though I liked much of the conceptual thrust that went into the making, there is a fundamental flaw at the center of the film's plot and in defiance of its own internal logic, when after having convinced the Fisher, Jr. character that he is dreaming and now speaking to one of his own subconscious projections (upon meeting up with “Mr. Charles” in the bar scene), Fisher is then led to an encounter with “Uncle Peter”, to be persuaded that a betrayal has been executed by same, in a “fake kidnapping” which is supposedly actually going on in the real world at this same time…if Peter is part of the dream projections taking place in this level of the fantasy, how is it that Fisher can experience a revelation that depends on his seeing the character of Uncle Peter for a fraud, when in actuality according to the same premise that has Fisher remembering that he supposedly is really asleep in the back of a van with Peter who was kidnapped along with him?…this sort of thing of course had to be left in to move the plot forward, but it immediately took me out of the movie, as it was so blatantly in opposition to the setup we were handed leading up to it…</p>

It's absoloutly outstanding. The acting, music, action, special effects, story line, the plot…everything was just so amazing! I loved every second of it. Yes it had similar things from the matrix (only the reality part) but that doesn't mean it is COPYING! Get it right. It took the director almost ten years to plan and write so give him some credit. He deserves a lot. This movie was amazing and honestly the best I've seen in a long time. ANd don't say 'Oh your only 15, you haven't seen good movies' well i have. So dont just asume. This movie is my favorite and my obsession! Lol.</p>
<p>-And for all the people who said it sucked well honestly i can say right now you probably didn't have the patience, an open mind, or the attention spand to even make it through this movie. Just becuase they weren't cracking jokes every five minuets doesn't mean its not a good film. Its a drama, action, thriller, scifi film. Not a comedy. I can honestly say while i was watching it, there were a bunch of hillbillie people at the end saying “IT DON'T MAKE ANY SENCE!” Obviously…they weren't paying attention and neither were all you people who said it sucked.</p>
<p>This is probably one of the best films of the decade <img alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" src="http://cdn.collider.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif"/> </p>

I wish I could get two and a half hours of my life back and spent it on watching “Despicable Me” again.  It was really-really bad!  And not confusing at all, very straight forward.  It was as bad as Matrix 2 and 3 combined.  And I hated those two.  Dialog was a complete cliche, every phrase out of Leo's mouth was a statement that I've heard in some other movie, absolutely no originality.  And predictable as anything, it totally didn't leave me hanging about the ending…  Leo was pretty to look at, but not enough to make this movie going experience worth it.</p>

Christopher Nolan is a film student's filmmaker. if you are not into the magic of movies to tell a story then this movie is more than likely not for you. let's be honest NO MOVIE is for EVERYONE. no matter what your opinion of this movie is Christopher Nolan put a lot of thought into this movie and that seems to me to be quite clear.</p>

When they convince Fischer Jr. that the raining city level is real life and the hotel is the first level of the dream, this causes Jr,'s projection of his uncle to be one of betrayal.

<div class="dsq-comment-message" id="dsq-comment-message-47648"><p>Dont forget, Cobb controlls her actions because she is only his prijection. So she tries to undermine everything because Cobb projects her as angry at him for not killing himself with her. So when he projects her in the dream, she would be trying to destroy everything because Cobb's mind makes her do it. It is also his way of punishing himself unconsciously for his performing inception on her which caused her to kill herself.</p>

<div class="dsq-comment-message" id="dsq-comment-message-47657"><p>A solid movie.  Probably the most memorable movie this year (a very weak year).  The review is right for the most part but I'd have to disagree with the point about the matrix.  The matrix had exactly the same impact at the time it came out 10 years ago if not more and is definitely more coherent than Inception. The matrix influenced this movie a great deal.  I remember telling people how The Matrix changed the game.  A blockbuster action movie mixed with depth, substance and philosophy.  That said, Nolan did a great job, the cast was well cast, that action sequence is the closest thing to the Matrix fight scenes and the imagination and courage of the movie.  Ken Watanabe had an accent so what- he held his own.  Gordon-Levitt esp. and Hardy are the one to watch for me.  Hollywood doesn't make good ambitious movies like this anymore.  The last one was Memento.<br/>It feels classic though but I'd have to rewatch again to see if it was a true classic like Memento and the Matrix.</p>

<div class="dsq-comment-message" id="dsq-comment-message-47973"><p>I'm a little bit disturbed by the short comments saying the movie sucked or that it was too confusing. The movie is actually pretty simple to understand. I see these responses a lot in my art history classes in college. I'm not a fan of abstract art persay, but I don't say that it sucks or it's horrible because I don't understand it. I see a lot of other students take a juvenile approach and make these sorts of comments out of ignorance. </p>
<p>Anyway, I saw the movie twice just for the heck of it. I was very impressed the first time around. Ever since The Departed I have been interested in DiCaprio in action movies. This movie isn't an action-packed Rambo style gorefest. There's a decent amount of action, but it's not over the top and it's not boring. I was never really that crazy about the Matrix, I feel that directors feel that action sequences and fight scenes have to be so over the top that the viewer can't even keep up, but I felt that the sequences in Inception were simple but had enough “umph” to impress me. I feel like all the razzle dazzle of special effects and 10 minute fight scenes and slomo effects are a result of how easily ammused society is today.</p>
<p>I had no bias towards this movie when I first saw it. I do prefer movies with good story and something that can draw me into the fantasy without feeling like I'm just sitting in a theater watching some people play make believe. This movie did that for me. I thought that the effects weren't over the top and were appropriately used. I felt that Nolan did an excellent job of breaking down the rules, exceptions and limitations of the world within the time frame of the movie. I do agree that Watanabe was a little difficult to understand, but I think he is an interesting actor all around, so this was only a minor disappointment.</p>
<p>Also, I couldn't believe some of the reviews I read elsewhere comparing Inception to Avatar. I'm sorry, but I feel that Avatar only gained popularity and positive response because of the visual effects which, I hate to break it to everyone, weren't that stunning. I've seen similar effects in video game CGI. I don't see these two movies on the same level, but that's just me.</p>

<div class="dsq-comment-message" id="dsq-comment-message-48073"><p>I found the movie to be pretty boring myself. There was far too much time spent breaking down the rules and not enough time spent developing the characters. I wasn't confused, I found the film easy to follow, and it was just boring. I knew from the very beginning what the last frame would be. There's not enough import in the mission. Sure, he gets to see his kids again, but the end result of the mission seemed too small scale. The only character studied in depth was Cobb, and he wasn't very interesting.</p>

Most movies give your brain a free ride because there is very little to concentrate on to understand the fullness of the movie. Its like hating math but loving art class. How much thought do you have to put into coloring or painting? SMH. The movie was amazing and the fact that you had to pay attention was even more appriciated. I adore leonardo for his role with this and shutter island. Both Great movies. Some people just dont like thinking. But you cant blame them if their brain is on Vaca lmao</p>

I just saw it last night and thought I had it all figured out, but I woke up with a spontaneously new interpretation of the films ending and started surfing reviews to see if anyone shared it. I think his is an awesome review. I have to disagree with your point about the snow mountain scene. As you delve deeper in the mind/ subconscious I think the lack of 'visual diversity’ is the point. The cold-like blankness implies depth and lack of conscious imaginative scope. It gave it a catacomb, ‘vaulty’ feel and created the sense that you are getting deeper in the recesses of the mind. Anywho, I will definitely be seeing this again. I have to b/c I’m neurotic about understanding things.</p>

It was too long, and the plot was equal to trigonometry. If your looking for a move with easy comprehension, humor or maybe even eye opening action (for get it). This movie is for the scientific, fantasy, virtual reality seekers. If this movie wins an oscar or even gets nominated, you have to ask yourself “what the hell were they watching for 2hours and 30minutes”. (Oh I know! the back of there eyelids)</p>

<div class="dsq-comment-message" id="dsq-comment-message-49673"><p>Great effects but the story line kind of got lost.  What was the whole point of the 3 stage dream anyway?  At first its for a code from the dieing father but it never says at the end, which makes you think is the whole film all a dream and the lead was in limbo the whole movie?  With all the great reviews I expected a much better movie.</p>

<div class="dsq-comment-message" id="dsq-comment-message-49810"><p>“Inception” is the the most bloated piece of over-serious hokum to float down the celluloid pike in a long while. At best it aspires to pretension. That the writing is little more than ridiculous expositional scaffolding is bad enough, that the cast is unable to realize engaged lives within it certainly makes this bad script worse.</p>

I might be wrong, but nobody seems to know what the plot was or if the “team” were even real or just his dream.</p>

Every once in a while a film comes around that shines so much brighter than the others out there and creates a whole new experience for the audience. This is one of those films. All I can say is, wow. This movie proves that incredible special effects and brilliant plots CAN go together, and when they do the result is awesome.</p>

<div class="dsq-comment-message" id="dsq-comment-message-52652"><p>Yes. I just saw it again and I can put to rest the theory that the kids are wearing the same clothes. Well, they’re not. Maybe the little boy is but not the little girl. If you focus on her dress in the dreams there is a red ruffled strip about 3 inches up from the bottom of the dress. At the end in the REAL WORLD, same dress but look at the strip. It’s clearly about 6 or more inches up from the bottom. Very subtle. So yes he is awake. It’s clear as day. I don’t know why people keep saying he was dreaming.</p>

Half of this film is sensless chasing and gun fighting that did not serve the story in any way. Take the computer game half off and you are left with a film where Nolan tries had to proof how smart it is. But I wasn’t convinced. The ever climaxing loud score did a good job in covering the empty soul of this item.        </p>

This is much simpler to make out than how a dream works.  :))</p>

It wasn’t as epic as it appeared in trailers, other reviews etc. and the storyline wasn’t what i expected, but it was still good. I found parts of it rather boring though and most of it rather confusing. However, in the end i think i got it. Also, the whole storyline is a little weird, that they need to go through all this stuff just to make one guy change his mind about something that really only effects them… i think. Still, i like the fact that in the end, all that happened in the layers of the dream were only for a few minutes in the real world, and that it would basically mean nothing to anyone else. </p>

<div class="dsq-comment-body" id="dsq-comment-body-90362">
<div class="dsq-comment-message" id="dsq-comment-message-90362"><p>Inception is a Christopher Nolan film which deals with a subject I’m most interested in, the subjective conscience of dreams. An interesting note is Christopher Nolan worked on the film for years and may have remained his mind all that time while taking in information over those years of tweaking and editing to the culmination of putting forth a seed thought into the movie Inception as well as other films over the years.  The seed of thought is cleverly interlaced into the movie namely the number 528 on the door of the hotel, the security code of the subject of inception plus others. This 528 number corresponds to the ancient solfeggio frequencies of nature, healing, slumber, and reality. </p>
<p>The “kicks” used in the movie are just that, of true frequencies that permeate our universe, signaling to us that we are about to be awaken and such is the movie Christopher has masterfully orchestrated to allow us to clue into this as he has himself. </p>
<p>If you were to investigate Thomas Metzinger’s work on philosophy you would find that our inner conscience is just that, of an inner dream realm of shared content. We never really know how we get into this world other than the physical host body we inhabit; but, Thomas’s theory is such that we were neither born nor do we die which is the state of being as in a dream of “nobody”.</p>
<p>It is true in this dream as in the dream of the participants of Christopher Nolan’s movie. There is a plan of inception, to plant certain concepts of life, existence into the sub-conscience of man.  In the movie there is a certain energy monopoly of the waking world at stake with the inheritance of the son of the trillion dollar energy consortium and as in movies imitating life and vice versa our inheritances’ are at stake also. </p>
<p>The complexity of the idea is important and the gain must be known as with Leonardo’s character the only one who has transcended unknown ground with inception. Much like Plato’s analogy of “The Cave” the only one who knows the stakes and has transcended out of the cave of our reality can say for certain what the goal of this life is. </p>
<p>Is this such a strange thought, as people to this day spend millions of hard earned dollars to gain enlightenment from some Guru, the unwitting public uses their own projections to create the shared reality of our world of what people ought to think do and say all for the illusion of civilization. We keep the strife of the world at bay by fooling ourselves this isn’t real and when our projections turn on us then our world attacks us and we get into a time of trouble because we are becoming aware of something and, this worlds projections, “the powers that be” don’t want that so they form a distraction. We forget what we were getting close to, our issue, and then create a harder shell or a bank vault around the thing we want to know so badly about ourselves.  The more you change your life the quicker the projections of our world come to attack us and until we can get to our inner self we are stuck in this abyss of not quite knowing but not quite sleeping or being content either.<br/>
The number of levels in Christopher Nolan’s movie is three. How many dream levels do we have, and are we lethargically settled in beds somewhere in heaven.<br/>

schizophrenic nightmare on film. To me… this was totally not believable… the story line did not mesh together. Ohhhh… three levels…. it could have gone down 6 levels and it still wouldn’t have worked. Also.. the casting was completely wrong… which was part of the reason why it was ‘unbelievable’. DiCaprio is one of the worst actors out there… his wife on film… was completely wrong… like she would have ever fallen for DiCaprio… and then the phony accents on all of them…. but to be fair… the entire cast just didn’t fit or work. Ill be putting the discs up on ebay immediately…. hopefully I can recoup some of my cost.</p>

<div class="dsq-comment-message" id="dsq-comment-message-98125"><p>Compared to the promise of the ideas involved I found this an incredibly disappointing film. Surely dreams and the lines between them and reality can be more interesting than one boring car chase or shoot out after another. While Memento left me with food for thought for days, the only thing I found challenging about this film was in trying to stay awake.  And by the way, it’s a shame that so many of those who like the film feel the need to insult those that don’t.</p>

<div class="dsq-comment-message" id="dsq-comment-message-98453"><p>I’m torn on this movie. Visually, it’s a masterpiece. Acting-wise, it has its moments. To be honest, I cringed a couple times at Leo’s poor acting, but oh well. The music score was just garden variety movie music. This coming from a musician, by the way. At times the movie seemed brilliant, other times just tedious. I kept having to wake my roommate up, if that says anything. I like the idea of the story, it’s a very clever premise to build upon. Pretty original, although it does sort of bring me back to Brainstorm from 1983. I know, that wasn’t about dreams, but still. I didn’t dislike the movie, I just found it overly complicated at times and sort of plodding too. The ending actually upset me a little bit. Like another reviewer here said, it’s a cheap way to end a story. It’s like tearing the last page from a mystery novel before finding out who did it. I don’t think it deserves best picture, but maybe best director and definitely best effects. Worth a rental.</p>

the people he works with are projections or I don’t know but I think he is in a sort of coma, so deep in different levels of dreams that he couldnt get out of limbo.<br/>

Saying inception is a “bad movie” or something like that is fully understandable since it’s not a movie for underagers you’ll require a mind of an adult to fully understand the movie and all the emotions it involves.</p>

<div class="dsq-comment-message" id="dsq-comment-message-101135"><p>This was a fantastic review of the first great movie of the 21st century (sorry Fincher, the Facebook movie just isn’t it).  The thing that I think will make this an enduring classic movie is simply because of the different ways it can be interpreted.  Was the whole thing a dream, or only parts?  Almost every little aspect of the movie from the sets to the totems to Cobb’s wife is up for discussion, what it means, why it’s there, was it part of reality or a dream world?  Moreover, is there a reality that is within our own dreams, the perfect self, the id that we all wish and wish we could simply snap into being, into true form.  As a DISH customer/employee I was recently able to re-re-re-watch Inception with the HD pay per view option and rarely has my viewing experience at home ever been comparable to that of the theater…but this time with my new 60 inch TV and surround sound system, I could bullets clattering on either side of me,m I could feel the top spinning on my coffee table in front of me, I walked by the crumbling buildings with Cobb and his wife.  I may have access to the most HD channels with DISH than with any other provider in the industry, but right now all I want is to watch this movie again!</p>

totally fair points you made.</p>
<p>I loved the film and I want to watch it again for the … 7th time now.<br/>
The oscars were fair also. Having seen black swann and the rest, i think king’s speech deserved it.<br/>

As if Nolan is going to bother reading all your criticisms for the sake of fixing an already complete movie. Everyone has different opinions. There might be a better movie than Inception later on, believe it or not. Stop with all the BS about how CRAP the movie is or how “It is the best movie everrrr”. Yeah, I think it’s a good movie but not to the extent of “OMG!! SOOOOOOOO GOOOD!!!” Get over it!</p>

Can’t believe he is the little boy from Angels in the out field!! Love to see him move he is a talented and excellent actor!! Iception has to be watch atleast 4 or 5 times to know whats going on. It looks good by confusing. Feels like a kind of matrix or takers more complex!!</p>

<p>Nolan likes to use hard-to-understand characters because it makes the audience listen closer.</p>
<p>I agree with the A merely because of the consistency of the movie. From the acting to the music to the action to the sets, everything is so smooth despite the complexity.</p>
