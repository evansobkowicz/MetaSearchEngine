PHOTOS found in the Echo archives show there was a 'Whole Lotta Love' in Southampton back in January 1973 when the city played host to one of the world’s biggest rock bands.<br/><br/>

For two consecutive nights Led Zeppelin graced two city venues, beginning with a show at the <a href="http://www.ledzepconcerts.com/concertdates/cd.php?id=lz19730121" target="_blank">Gaumont Theatre on January 21</a>, that was watched by two-and-a-half thousand Zeppelin fans, who flooded into the venue to watch the rock and roll heavyweights perform live.<br/><br/>

<strong>Physical Graffiti Playback Event:<br/>
Tuesday, February 3rd, 2015:<br/>
Olympic Studios – Barnes, London<br/>
Hosted by Jimmy Page</strong><br/><br/>

Just back from this afternoon’s Physical Graffiti Listening Event Playback hosted by Jimmy Page at Olympic Studios in Barnes London – all seven tracks on the forthcoming Companion Disc were played on the stunning sound system against a backdrop of equally stunning  Physical Graffiti artwork and 1975 era photos and visuals brilliantly put together by Warner Music’s Jason Morais. Jimmy then conducted a very entertaining  Q and A. The event was attended by a variety of TV, radio and press representatives. John Davis, who did the mastering on the reissues with Jimmy was also in attendance.<br/><br/>

<p>RUFUS STONE LIMITED EDITIONS – FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE FEB 4th 2015<br/><br/> RUFUS STONE TO RELEASE <strong>LED ZEPPELIN – FIVE GLORIOUS NIGHTS</strong> TO CELEBRATE THE 40TH ANNIVERSARY OF LED ZEPPELINS APPEARANCE AT EARLS COURT IN 1975<br/><br/> In May 1975, Led Zeppelin performed five momentous concerts at the Earls Court Arena in London to a combined audience of 85,000 fans. It found the band at the peak of their powers, slaying the sold out audiences with a nightly marathon three and a half hour presentation of light, sound, power and energy. Led Zeppelin’s appearances at Earls Court represented a career high for the group and four decades on, are still held in the highest esteem by the vast following.<br/><br/> They were also some of their most visually appealing shows complete with pioneering laser effects, a large video projection screen and the band themselves more than dressed for the occasion – Jimmy Page in a two piece dragon suit, Robert Plant with a cut off shirt allowing for bare chested narcissism, John Paul Jones in a quirky Spanish jacket complete with onions and John Bonham in a glittering T-shirt high on the drum rostrum.<br/><br/> Now for the first time, an extensive collection of timeless images of Led Zeppelin on stage at Earls Court in all their regal splendour, are brought together in a de-luxe limited edition volume.<br/><br/> <strong>Five Glorious Nights</strong> – Led Zeppelin at Earls Court May 1975 captures the visual magnificence of the band though the photographic images of some of the finest rock photographers of the era – who were right there on the spot to capture rock history.<br/><br/> Drawing from the archives of variety of photographers including Barry Plummer, Dick Barnatt, Ian Dickson, Michael Putland, Mick Gold, Gus Stewart and more – the book chronicles the sheer visual splendour of these historic concerts though an extensive collection of colour and black and white photos – many of them rarely seen. The photos are complimented by rare memorabilia and a written commentary that puts into perspective exactly why these concerts were some of the finest Led Zeppelin ever performed.<br/><br/> The book is compiled by Dave Lewis – the highly respected Led Zeppelin archivist and author and editor of the long running Led Zeppelin magazine Tight But Loose. Dave was in attendance at all five of the Earls Court concerts.<br/><br/> Published on the 40th anniversary of the event and as sadly, the bulldozers move in to demolish the Earls Court Exhibition Centre itself, Five Glorious Nights – Led Zeppelin at Earls Court May 1975 offers a permanent visual record of a band at their absolute zenith – in a setting that truly justified their status as the world’s greatest live rock attraction.<br/><br/> Five glorious nights in May 1975 – relive them through the visual splendour of this magnificent deluxe volume that captures the power and glory of Led Zeppelin on stage at Earls Court 40 years ago...<br/><br/> The book will be available in a strict limited edition quantity, individually numbered and will ship on the anniversary date of the Earls Court shows.

It's that simple.<br/><br/> The market for "investment books" has grown over the last few years but this means limited edition high-end products can sell for £400 up to £3000. Even we think this is a little steep. Our approach is to generate high quality, bespoke content in short runs at a price point people can afford. Yes, they are still expensive but you are buying a product that can't be purchased on the highstreet, that features hours of investment in intellectual content and the very highest production standards. Quite simply we only produce books and boxsets we'd buy ourselves.<br/><br/> As the "label" grows we have plans for some exciting and unsual books. We'd like to work directly with a variety of artistes and bands at all levels with projects starting at just 250 copies. Of course, some of our titles will be gloriously unofficial but sometimes that makes for a better, more independent product. You'll get to read and see stuff your favourite artiste might not be over the moon with... but that's why you love them.. right?<br/><br/> Rufus Stone has released sell out books on Deep Purple, Ronnie James Dio and the legendary Jon Lord.<br/><br/> <a href="http://www.rufuspublications.com" target="_blank">www.rufuspublications.com</a><br/><br/> <span id="cloak24153">This email address is being protected from spambots.

<p>I just found this little nugget of goodness for #tbt. Back in the late 1998, I furiously sequenced out all Led Zeppelin songs in MIDI format. Through moving the website around around a half a dozen times over the past 19 years, I apparently had lost the MIDI file folder with all the songs.<br/><br/> Thanks to the Internet Archive's <a href="https://archive.org/web/" target="_blank">WaybackMachine</a>, I was able to find them. So, without further adieu, in all its glory, here is the MIDI file for <em>Achilles Last Stand</em>.<br/><br/>

<p>Next month, Led Zeppelin will reissue their sixth album, the 1975 double LP <em>Physical Graffiti</em>, with a disc's worth of unreleased versions of the record's songs. Among these is a rough mix of the funky hard-rock radio staple "Houses of the Holy."</p>
<p>Slightly shorter than the version that appeared on the original album, the rough mix places guitarist and producer Jimmy Page's iconic riff in the right speaker and reduces some of the high end. The bass is more prominent, John Bonham's percussion sounds looser in the verses and the overdubbed stabbing guitar line toward the end of the song is more prominent. On top of that, Robert Plant's harmonies on the line "Let the music be your master" are even more present.</p>
<p>"'Houses of the Holy' is unlike anything that anyone was doing," guitarist and producer Jimmy Page tells <em>Rolling Stone</em>. "It's just something that's totally of its own. I think the lyrics are brilliant on it."</p>

<p>The rest of the reissue includes rough mixes of "Trampled Under Foot" (titled "Brandy &amp; Coke") and "In My Time of Dying," an early version of "Sick Again," a Sunset Sound mix of "Boogie With Stu" and a rough orchestra mix of "Kashmir" that's titled "Driving Through Kashmir." It also contains what the band has billed as a "strikingly different" take on "In the Light."</p>
<p>As with last year's reissues, the new edition of <em>Physical</em> Graffiti, which Page personally remastered,<em> </em>will be available in a variety of formats, including standard CD, vinyl and digital releases. A super deluxe version will contain CDs, vinyl and links to high-def audio, as well as a hard-bound, 96-page book containing rare and previously uncirculated photos and memorabilia.</p>

			Chad Smith Drums in Hallowed Home Where Led Zeppelin Recorded</a>

Chad Smith has now walked in the footsteps of Led Zeppelin. "Holy Grail of drum sounds," the Red Hot Chili Peppers drummer tweeted today, along with a video that shows him and Queen drummer Roger Taylor playing in Headley Grange, a private English residence where Zeppelin made some of their most famous recordings in the early '70s. Smith was the first person to record drums there since his favorite drummer, Led Zep's John Bonham, 40 years ago, according to his management.<br/><br/>

Headley Grange is where Jimmy Page came up with "Stairway to Heaven." More significant for drummers, it's where Bonham and engineer Andy Johns recorded "When the Levee Breaks," creating a sound that Queen's Taylor describes in the video as "like thunder" and "the benchmark" that "so many people strived for." Joining Smith and Taylor in the studio for the video is drummer Andy Gangadeen, who has played with British drum-and-bass duo Chase &amp; Status as well as on Massive Attack‘s influential 1998 album Mezzanine.<br/><br/>

The occasion for the drummers' Headley Grange spiritual homecoming was a five-day set of recording sessions last summer, organized by sample library Spitfire Audio. Smith, Taylor and Gangadeen were there to create a set of loops, breaks, beats and hits for other musicians to use in their tracks. They recorded using a variety of modern and vintage mics and preamps, along with a 24-track, two-inch Studer tape deck.<br/><br/>

"To be able to just look up and see the way the stairs go, just to be in that space and play those notes and be in this same air, goosebumps, man," Smith says in the video. "It was amazing." When he arrived at Headley Grange, he kissed the floor of the hall.<br/><br/>

Besides Zeppelin, other bands that recorded at this rural manor house in the '60s and '70s included Genesis, Bad Company and Fleetwood Mac.<br/><br/>

The title for the clip says it's a teaser for NAMM, which is the National Association of Music Merchants trade show, held January 22 to January 25 in Anaheim, California. Let's hope for more glimpses of the Grail next week, then.<br/><br/>

As for Smith's doppelganger, Will Ferrell, it's been a few months since the two rekindled their The Tonight Show drum-off with a Rolling Stones cover in Seattle. And they might not be done.<br/><br/>

"I can't really expound upon details, but we have been talking about doing something [in 2015] that will combine music and comedy ­— a show,"  Smith recently told Rolling Stone. "It will benefit the charities that we're into. Plus, I think I need to redeem myself from how I was robbed of the Golden Cowbell. I don't want to burst any bubbles, but he wasn't even playing the drums, people! Shenanigans! Call the cops, I've been robbed! Yeah, so, it's not over." Guess this means they won't invite Ferrell to the Grange?<br/><br/>

Jimmy Page, the Led Zeppelin guitarist who turned 71 last week, is reportedly dating 25-year-old actress Scarlett Sabet.<br/><br/>

As radio station Q107 puts into context below, Page's daughter (also named Scarlet) is 43, which is 18 years older than his new girlfriend.<br/><br/>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p><a href="https://twitter.com/JimmyPage">@JimmyPage</a> dating 25 yr old "actress" Scarlett Sabet who is 18 yrs younger than his daughter Scarlet. <a href="https://twitter.com/ledzeppelin">@ledzeppelin</a> <a href="http://t.co/y9wRkrHf8c">pic.twitter.com/y9wRkrHf8c</a></p>— Q107 Toronto (@Q107Toronto) <a href="https://twitter.com/Q107Toronto/status/554676955250184193">January 12, 2015</a></blockquote>
<br/><br/>

Jimmy Page has a history of dating much younger women, from his most recent ex-wife Jimena Gomez-Paratcha right back to the early led Zeppelin days. Rolling Stone reports that in the early '70s Page dated a 14-year-old, Lori Maddox.<br/><br/>

Robbie Williams has become embroiled in a planning dispute with his Led Zeppelin legend neighbour Jimmy Page.<br/><br/>
The former Take That star wants to do up his £17million mansion in Holland Park, west London by installing a lift and a recording studio.<br/><br/>
But his plans have not gone down well with neighbour Jimmy Page, who has objected to the changes in a strongly-worded letter to Kensington and Chelsea Council.<br/><br/>
Williams, 40, bought the 46-room mansion from late film director Michael Winner in 2013.<br/><br/>
He now wants to carry out a number of interior alterations to turn the Victorian mansion into a contemporary family home.<br/><br/>
The plans - which also include the installation of a lift and a recording studio - have been poorly received by Page, who lives in the Grade I listed Tower House nearby.<br/><br/>
The musician - whose band's hits included Whole Lotta Love - has owned the landmark home for more than 40 years and regards it as one of the most important properties in the borough.<br/><br/>
In a strongly-worded letter to the council, Page has expressed a number of concerns.<br/><br/>
He wrote: 'I have been responsible for the protection of the Tower House for over 40 years and I am always concerned when proposals are made for nearby properties which may be detrimental to the well-being of this important heritage asset.'<br/><br/>
Page says because Williams' house is Grade II listed, the exterior should be considered 'sacrosanct'.<br/><br/>
He says a new window planned will overlook the side of his house and his back garden, which will have a 'significant impact on the amenity' of his property.<br/><br/>
The rockstar is also concerned that work on the underground swimming pool could cause 'vibrations and possible structural' damage to Tower House.<br/><br/>
Page, aged 71, also objects to Williams knocking down part of his home's boundary wall to allow access to a planned garden car park.<br/><br/>
He wrote: '[This] will be detrimental to the general amenity of the conservation area as well as destroying part of the attractive boundary wall.'<br/><br/>
Williams' planning application states the building work will take place from early this month until October this year, with workmen accessing the site between 8am and 6pm on Mondays to Fridays and 8am and 1pm on Saturdays.<br/><br/>
He promises no work will be carried out on Sundays or Bank Holidays and reversing vehicles will be guided in by 'suitably qualified banksman'.<br/><br/>
Page bought Tower House in 1972. The 19th century, Grade I listed home was built by William Burgess and, in the 1960s, was saved from demolition after a campaign led by John Betjeman and Evelyn Waugh.<br/><br/>
Williams' house also has a colourful history. The property was bought by George Winner for £2,000 in 1946.<br/><br/>
It was the home Michael Winner grew up in. The Death Wish director took the property over in 1978, transforming it from three flats into his own personal palace.<br/><br/>
Winner put the mansion on the market for £60 million in 2011, but he couldn't find a buyer.<br/><br/>
The director passed away in January 2013, with Williams buying the home later that year for £17.5 million.<br/><br/>
He submitted the plans to Kensington and Chelsea Council in December with the public consultation ending on January 2.<br/><br/>
A decision on the plans is expected by the end of the month. Both parties declined to comment.<br/><br/>

Led Zeppelin fans will recognize some of the more classic Led Zeppelin interviews and articles, like Zeppelin's first concert review from December 1968 <a href="http://www.led-zeppelin.org/led-zeppelin-in-the-media/85-rock-concert-is-real-groovy-dec-29-1968" target="_blank">'Rock Concert Is Real Groovy'</a>, or anything from Cameron Crowe or Rolling Stone or the 1977 article from Stephen Rosen.<br/><br/>
<u>Led Zeppelin On Led Zeppelin: Interview And Encounters</u>, edited by Hank Bordowitz, presents fifty-one lesser-known articles and interviews about Led Zeppelin and their members from 1968 up until 2011, from music commentator Ritchie Yorke, Chris Welch, HP Newquist and Rick McGrath, to name a few. Even William S. Burroughs' article on Jimmy Page, which appeared in the June 1975 issue of <em>Crawdaddy</em> is presented, complete with transcript of their actual meeting.<br/><br/>

Even though these articles are lesser-known to a larger percentage of fans, they still are important. They stray from the usual tabloid rock writer formula, which seeks to write on the sex, drugs and rock and roll. I will admit that there is plenty on rock and roll, however these articles presented also dive deeper into the very core of the four people in Led Zeppelin. My take is that there weren't microphones shoved down their throats and the guys were not feeling threatened during the interviews. They come forth as being very genuine and honest about what they have to say about being taken along the journies of their careers. They were very willing to say what was on their minds and let the readers into their souls.<br/><br/>

One thing that is pleasing to read in articles that were written in the time period after Led Zeppelin disbanded, in the 1980s, that instantly Plant was trying to move forward from the ashes and establish himself as a solo artist. That this wasn't just a decision that he made after the 2007 reunion concert. All this time, he had been publically stating the very same thing. On the same note, through his own words, or lack of words, it shows Jimmy Page painting his own picture about his future after Led Zeppelin.<br/><br/>

This truly is a fascinating and exciting collection presented in this book. It truly allows the reader to experience a more personal insight and, to a certain extent, breaks down a bit of the whole mystique of Led Zeppelin as a whole, without destroying that revered image that so many millions of fans have, allowing them to know Robert Plant, Jimmy Page, John Paul Jones and John Bonham as real people.<br/><br/>

Oh, and if you wanted to know the meaning being the title of <em>Hats Off To (Roy) Harper</em>, Jimmy Page talks about that in a August 4, 1979 article from NME magazine.<br/><br/>

The 1954 electric guitar that served as the prototype for Gibson's iconic Les Paul models is going on the auction block.<br/><br/>

The Paul-designed guitar known as "Black Beauty" features gold-plated hardware. Paul played it for more two decades and made frequent modifications as he refined its sound. <a href="http://www.guernseys.com/Guernseys%20New/tom_doyle.html" target="_blank">Guernsey's</a> is offering it Feb. 19 in New York City. The auctioneer calls it the most significant electric guitar ever made. Its market value will be determined at auction.<br/><br/>

The famous jazz, country and blues guitarist played it in concerts, recordings and on the "Les Paul and Mary Ford" television show. Paul, whose hits songs included "How High the Moon," died in 2009. He gave the instrument to his friend, guitar technician and builder Tom Doyle of Wantage, New Jersey.<br/><br/>

Produced And Newly Remastered By Jimmy Page,<br/>
With Previously Unreleased Companion Audio<br/><br/>

The Led Zeppelin reissue campaign continues in 2015, turning the spotlight on the double album Physical Graffiti. The deluxe edition of the group’s sixth studio album will arrive 40 years after the original debuted on February 24, 1975. The reissues of the first five Led Zeppelin albums in 2014 found both commercial successes, with multiple titles reaching Top 10 chart status in countries around the world, as well as widespread critical acclaim, including the recent Classic Rock “Reissue Of The Year” Award.<br/><br/>

Certified 16x platinum in the U.S., the commercial success of Physical Graffiti was equaled by its critical reception. Generally regarded as one of the greatest double albums of all time, the original 15 tracks represent a creative tour de force that explores the band’s dynamic musical range, from the driving rock of “Custard Pie” and acoustic arrangement of “Bron-Y-Aur Stomp” to the Eastern raga of “Kashmir” and funky groove of “Trampled Under Foot.”<br/><br/>

The companion audio disc that accompanies the deluxe edition of Physical Graffiti has seven unreleased tracks, including rough mixes of “In My Time Of Dying” and “Houses Of The Holy,” as well as an early mix of “Trampled Under Foot” called “Brandy &amp; Coke.” All the unreleased companion tracks offer fans a chance to hear well-known songs from a different perspective, including the Sunset Sound mix of “Boogie With Stu” and “Driving Through Kashmir,” a rough orchestra mix of the band’s eight minute opus “Kashmir.” Also featured is “Everybody Makes It Through,” a strikingly different early version of “In The Light” with alternate lyrics.<br/><br/>

In 1968, John Bonham, John Paul Jones, Jimmy Page and Robert Plant formed Led Zeppelin, one of the most influential, innovative and successful groups in modern music, having sold more than 300 million albums worldwide. The band rose from the ashes of The Yardbirds, when Page brought in Plant, Bonham and Jones to tour as The New Yardbirds. In 1969, Led Zeppelin released its self-titled debut. It marked the beginning of a 12-year reign, during which the group was widely considered to be the biggest and most innovative rock band in the world.<br/><br/>

Led Zeppelin continues to be honoured for its pivotal role in music history. The band was inducted into the Rock &amp; Roll Hall of Fame in 1995, received a Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award in 2005, and a year later was awarded with the Polar Music Prize in Stockholm. Founding members Jones, Page and Plant – along with Jason Bonham, the son of John Bonham – took the stage at London’s O2 Arena in 2007 to headline a tribute concert for Ahmet Ertegun, a dear friend and Atlantic Records’ founder. The band was honored for its lifetime contribution to American culture at the Kennedy Center Honors in 2012. In January of 2014, the band won their first ever Grammy award as Celebration Day, which captured their live performance at the Ertegun tribute concert, was named Best Rock Album.<br/><br/>

CORONA (CBSLA.com) — A podiatrist is offering a $5,000 reward for the return of vintage record albums he says were stolen from his Corona practice.<br/><br/>
Jeffrey Katz says someone broke in through the roof of his office over the Thanksgiving holiday weekend and stole several irreplaceable albums, <strong>including all eight Led Zeppelin albums, signed by all four band members.</strong><br/><br/>
The vintage albums were previously locked in a vault but Katz decided to showcase them in his office and share them with his patients and staff.<br/><br/>
Photographs showed that his walls were once lined with some of rock ‘n’ roll’s finest, including The Beatles. Also taken were albums by Fleetwood Mac and Eric Clapton.<br/><br/>
“When I asked him, ‘Are you mad? Upset,’ he said, ‘You know what? It’s sad’ because they mean something to him. He went to a lot of the concerts as a young man,” said Sherie Tavernier, a staff member.<br/><br/>
Katz estimates that the albums are worth $200,000 to $400,000. The albums weren’t insured.<br/><br/>
“It’s pretty depressing and pretty sad,” he said.<br/><br/>
He’s since filed a police report.<br/><br/>

			Happy 69th Birthday, John Paul Jones!</a>

Today (January 3) is John Paul Jones’ 69th birthday. He has been a professional musician for over 50 years, with 12 of those most famously in Led Zeppelin. If all that you listen to is his Zeppelin, you are sorely missing out on a musical maestro. Each song that he has performed on, every song that he has arranged for, every song that he has produced is pure genius. There is no way to narrow down a lifetime of virtuosity into a short, however, I present here my personal selection of tracks, in no particular order, that John Paul Jones has been a part of that shines brightly.
<h2><em>A Foggy Day In Vietnam</em></h2>
<iframe frameborder="0" height="413" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/n7MGlA4VKoI" width="550"></iframe><br/><br/> Most every young studio musician dreams of that one day when they can record their own music. 18 year old Jones recorded this nearly instrumental number in 1964 for Pye Records. Jones played some excellent honky tonk upright piano on this track. It is very reminiscent of songs later in his career, like <em>Hot Dog</em> and <em>Darlene</em> &amp; his 1977 piano solos during <em>No Quarter</em>.<br/><br/>
<h2><em>Scumbag Blues</em></h2>
<iframe frameborder="0" height="309" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/f9Hacr7qji8" width="550"></iframe><br/><br/> This song starts out with a killer riff, heavy 4-string bass and layers guitar over that. Then it changes into a signature John Paul Jones walking bass run in the pre-chorus. The second half of the pre-chorus has some funky clavinet work. All that plus Jones contributing some backup vocals and mini improv bass solos when performed live.<br/><br/>
<h2>Skótoseme</h2>
<iframe frameborder="0" height="413" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/f0AIjnQ8t30" width="550"></iframe><br/><br/> Jones has never been afraid to stray from traditional rock and roll. This has never been held more true than with the album <a href="http://amzn.to/UqDCfC" target="_blank">The Sporting Life</a> with avant-garde singer Diamanda Galás. To most ears, her vocals sound unintelligible, however, <em>Skótoseme</em> (Greek for “kill me”) has some tasty bass work on a Manson 8-string bass, wired in stereo and drums by Pete Thomas, Elvis Costello’s drummer, who later played on Jones’ first solo album in 1999, Zooma.<br/><br/>
<h2>The Lemon Song</h2>
<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="309" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/Zyhu2ysqKGk" width="550"></iframe><br/><br/> <em>The Lemon Song</em> features exemplary bass runs that many budding bass guitarists have often tried to imitate (including yours truly). Recorded virtually live in Mystic Studios in 1969, Jones is definitely pulling from his roots to pull this song off.<br/><br/>
<h2><em>Dazed And Confused</em></h2>
<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="413" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/BzZ6pyRGI30" width="550"></iframe><br/><br/> The second that you hear the haunting, descending bass line, you can instantly tell that it’s John Paul Jones in Dazed And Confused from Led Zeppelin. In the first few albums, you can tell that Jones and Jimmy Page were experimenting with different studio tricks and the tone of the bass is a bit muted, lacking some natural echo that you hear in most other tracks. It adds to the overall psychedelic loneliness that creeps over you.<br/><br/> When this song was played live and it stretched to over 30 minutes in length, not once could you tell that Jones was straining to keep up with the guitar or drums. He was perfectly locked within the groove.<br/><br/>
<h2><em>Stairway To Heaven</em></h2>
<iframe frameborder="0" height="309" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/BcL---4xQYA" width="550"></iframe><br/><br/> Some may look at <em>Stairway To Heaven</em> and think that it’s a Page track. How untrue? Jones was all over the place on this song. In addition to Fender Rhodes keyboard action that fills in against the beautiful Page guitar work and unreal bass guitar runs, there is no other song that better rocks out on a quartet of bass recorders, all played by Jones. You simply cannot get any more badass than that.<br/><br/>
<h2><em>Tidal</em> (Guitar Wars version)</h2>
<iframe frameborder="0" height="413" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/sGHWxLruLvA" width="550"></iframe><br/><br/> Riding high from the underground success of two solo albums and supporting tours, Jones accepted the invitation to appear at Guitar Wars 2003 in Tokyo, Japan. The JPJ Orchestra was in full force with Nuno Bettencourt on guitar, Jones on 10-string Manson bass, Roger King on keyboards, Mike Szuter who came in later on the track on bass guitar &amp; Paul Mastelotto on drums.<br/><br/> Jones was definitely feeling his oats, switching on some effects and taking on a freaking impressive outro bass guitar solo.<br/><br/>
<h2><em>The Song Remains The Same</em> (live version)</h2>
<iframe frameborder="0" height="413" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/4m2FhRv8xF0" width="550"></iframe><br/><br/> While Jimmy Page is busy weaving his guitar magic, John Paul Jones, with assistance from the drums, lays down a heavy foundation. Not satisfied with playing root notes to maintain the beat, Jones is all over the fretboard, finding a way to play some solo-sounding rhythm work.<br/><br/>
<h2><em>No Quarter</em> (live version)</h2>
<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="413" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/BrXpPLUYJlE" width="550"></iframe><br/><br/> John Paul Jones was so much more than a bass guitarist and this track exemplifies this. Originally, in 1970, <em>No Quarter</em> had a faster tempo and patched together several different contrasting parts. When it was time to record <em>No Quarter</em> in the studio in early 1972, it was slowed down and the whole song was dropped a semi-tone in pitch to add to the mysteriousness of the song.<br/><br/> This song was premiered on the second leg of the 1973 Summer US tour up until Led Zeppelin’s last date in 1980. It showcased John Paul Jones’ abilities on the keyboards, with lengthy piano solos added in the middle of the song.<br/><br/>
<h2>Ice Fishing At Night</h2>
<iframe frameborder="0" height="413" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/au1PPGOjrNo" width="550"></iframe><br/><br/> Some electronica starts this song off and then a simple piano passage begins. If you thought that John Paul Jones was only an instrumentalist, you were wrong. Jones adds in a very tender set of lyrics that has the aural mysticism of a classic oil painting. The piano continues into a solo passage that has a second piano part overdubbed. This is truly a non-traditional John Paul Jones-sounding masterpiece.

<img alt="Rose Parade" border="0" height="194" src="/images/news/126_Rose_Parade.png" width="550"/><br/><br/>

While millions of viewers from over 100 countries view the 126th annual <a href="http://www.tournamentofroses.com/" target="_blank">Tournament of Roses</a> Parade this morning, it is interesting to know that there is a connection to Led Zeppelin that few people know about.<br/><br/>

On <a href="http://www.ledzepconcerts.com/concertdates/cd.php?id=lz19690502" target="_blank">May 2-3, 1969</a>, Led Zeppelin headlined a pair of concerts at the Rose Palace, in Pasadena, California. This venue was located at 835 South Raymond Avenue, a few miles from the parade route, in a warehouse that was built for parade construction.<br/><br/>

Parade float construction primarily takes place from October through the end of December of each year. The venue is currently occupied by <a href="http://www.phoenixdeco.com/" target="_blank">The Phoenix Decorating Company</a>, one of the main float construction companies for the parade.<br/><br/>

The outside of the Rose Palace wasnt much to look at--just a large, long building with a sign over the double doors saying this was the place. But the inside was a different story, mainly because of the people. The interior had a high ceiling. Astroturf on the floor, and a stage that was small in comparison to the ones Zeppelin used later. <em>(from <a href="http://amzn.to/13XI4Mx" target="_blank">Whole Lotta Led: Our Flight with Led Zeppelin</a> by Ralph Hulett, Jerry Prochnicky)</em><br/><br/>

Legendary drummer Carmine Appice (OZZY OSBOURNE, ROD STEWART, VANILLA FUDGE, JEFF BECK, GUITAR ZEUS, KING KOBRA) says that he would love to play with a reunited Led Zeppelin, claiming that he is a better fit to replace late Zeppelin drummer John Bonham than is John's son Jason.<br/><br/>

Asked by the "Totally Driven Radio" podcast if there is anyone left that he would like to share the stage with, Carmine said (hear audio below): "I would like to work with a Led Zeppelin configuration, whether it's just John Paul Jones and Jimmy Page and me and a singer. I've heard that they're talking, maybe, to Ann Wilson [HEART]... There's a rumor that Ann Wilson might go out with them. I would love to play drums on something like that."<br/><br/>

When it was pointed out to Carmine that Jason Bonham would almost certainly land the drummer gig in a hypothetical Zeppelin reunion, Appice said: "Everybody in that band there is legendary… They're old school and legendary. Jason isn't legendary, and he's not old school. He's John Bonham's son, but he don't play like John Bonham. He plays more… He plays like him. He's not John. He's got that name, but he's not John Bonham. I'm not John Bonham either, but I think my style might be close, 'cause I came first, and John listened to stuff I did and did it his own way. And we took 'em on their first tour. It's very close-sounding stuff in feel."<br/><br/>

He continued: "When John passed away, there was rumors that I was gonna join Led Zeppelin, but obviously I didn't get to do that. But, you know... whatever. I would like to do that. Whether they get Jason or not, I would still like to do that."<br/><br/>

Asked earlier this year in an interview with Journey Of A Frontman what it means to him to know that he was one of John Bonham's favorite drummers, Carmine responded: "It's nice. But it's not like I strive on it or anything. It's nice that the timing worked out the way it did. He came out two to two and a half years after I did. He listed me as one of his idols. I helped him and took him under my wing. It went beyond that, actually, because we were friends. Back in those days, we were all friends. Ginger Baker, Mitch Mitchell, Keith Moon, John Bonham... we all knew each other. The drummers today, they're all big, giant fans of John Bonham. I wasn't a fan; I was more of a friend."<br/><br/>

Carmine Appice previously said that Bonham took the bass drum triplets from the Vanilla Fudge song <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IpkXMSvwmZw" target="blank">Ticket To Ride</a>, telling Classic Rock Revisited in a 2006 interview: "When I first heard John Bonham do that triplet thing on the bass drum, I went up to him and said, 'John, that is amazing. I have to admit that I took that from you.' He looked at me and said, 'What are you talking about? I took that from you!' I replied, 'I don't do that. You couldn't have taken it from me.' He proceeded to tell me where I did actually do that on the first Vanilla Fudge record and he was right. I only did it for a moment on that album and he took it and made something bigger and better out of it."<br/><br/>

In a recent interview, Page revealed that he is readying material for a new project.<br/><br/> <em>"I'm playing guitar at the moment,"</em> Page said. <em>"Because I'm getting ready. Starting to get ready...Whatever I do, I don't want people to have made up their minds before I've done it. They already have. On the internet, people are telling me, 'you're doing this, and you're doing that'...'Am I?' Just wait and see what I do. I've got new material that I've written, and it will be surprising."</em><br/><br/> If and when Page does strike out on his own, he will not jettison the Zeppelin material he's famous for, but he is dead set on avoiding the pitfalls of a rote retrospection.<br/><br/> <em>"I don't want to go out there and bore people,"</em> the guitarist explained. <em>"If I was doing a show or something, I'd like to show what I've done along the way but definitely have musical surprises for people so they wouldn't start yawning."</em><br/><br/> So don't worry, everyone. Page won't just be playing two-hour "Stairway To Heaven" solos. Although, hmm, that would be pretty great. Do what you feel, Jimmy!<br/><br/> From: <a href="http://www.rocksquare.com/community/musicnews/4707" target="_blank">Rock Square</a></p>
